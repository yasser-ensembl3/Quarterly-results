Third Quarter 2025 October 30, 2025



## Page 2

Fellow Q3 was a strong quarter for Coinbase. We drove solid financial results, maintained focus on shipping
Shareholders, innovative products, and continued building the foundation of the Everything Exchange.
We laid out our vision of an Everything Exchange last quarter, and made progress in Q3 by increasing the
number of tradable spot assets, expanding our derivatives offerings, and continuing to lay the groundwork for
additional pillars. By increasing tradable spot assets, our platform now covers approximately 90% of total crypto
asset market capitalization. Our derivatives business reached an all-time high share across several markets,
including U.S. crypto futures and global crypto options, with the launch of U.S. perpetuals and 24/7 futures
trading, and the close of the Deribit acquisition.
We are accelerating payments through stablecoin adoption, which we anticipate will continue given policy
tailwinds, and ongoing adoption from financial institutions and corporates for payment and treasury needs. In
Q3, USDC reached an all-time high of $74 billion in market capitalization, and average USDC held in Coinbase
products reached an all-time high of over $15 billion. Additionally, we continue to scale payments with USDC,
new partnerships, and crypto rewards for purchases through the CB1 Card.
With regulatory clarity accelerating, crypto rails are set to power more of global GDP, and we believe Coinbase
is positioned to lead. We’re progressing toward the Everything Exchange vision, and scaling payments by
advancing stablecoin adoption with USDC.

Product Update. In Q3, Coinbase continued advancing across all three phases of crypto adoption. As an
investment, we executed on the foundations of the Everything Exchange vision: expanding tradable spot
assets (including integrated DEX access), scaling U.S. perpetual futures, adding global options platform with
Deribit, and strengthening custody. As a financial service, we made it simple to pay, earn, borrow, and run
businesses onchain. And as a new app platform, we continue to drive sub-second, sub-cent transactions on
Base, best paired with stablecoins as trusted digital money for seamless payments. We continue to see strong
adoption across each phase, driving our mission to increase economic freedom worldwide.

helped drive Advanced trading volumes and amplified our concerted efforts to attract and retain high priority
traders through a new white glove service offering.
Further, we made important progress in expanding tradable assets for our retail customers in Q3: more spot
assets through CEX listings and DEX integration, more derivatives through the launch of perpetual futures and
24/7 futures trading in the U.S.
Institutional Transaction Revenue. Institutional Trading Volume was $236 billion, up 22% Q/Q. Institutional
transaction revenue was $135 million, up 122% Q/Q. Several factors drove the increase in revenue, most
notably Deribit (closed on August 14), which contributed $52 million of revenue in Q3 driven by continued
growth of options trading leading to all-time high notional volumes. Deribit and Coinbase collectively achieved
over $840 billion of notional derivatives trading volume in Q3 on the back of innovative new products launched
to date. Given the momentum we are seeing across our growing portfolio of derivatives products, we have
begun to scale back rebates and incentives (which, as a reminder, is recognized as contra revenue).
Additionally, we saw strength in Coinbase Prime trading, driven by more active customers and deeper product
engagement, with a growing number of Prime customers now engaging with 3+ products.
Other Transaction Revenue. Other transaction revenue was $68 million, up 26% Q/Q primarily driven by an
increase in instant transfer activity which is typically correlated with the growth in Trading Volume. To a lesser
extent, Base revenue growth was driven by higher average ETH price and a higher number of transactions,
partially offset by lower average revenue per transaction as a result of our continued focus on scaling the
network. Base remains the #1 L2, and its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency has made it the trusted network
of choice for a growing number of enterprises and developers.

Subscription and Services Revenue
Q3 subscription and services revenue was $747 million, up 14% Q/Q. Strong native unit inflows drove another
quarter of all-time highs including average USDC balances, average loan balances across our institutional
financing products, and Assets Under Custody. We ended Q3 with $516 billion in total Assets on Platform.
Stablecoin revenue was $355 million in Q3, up 7% Q/Q. Average USDC balances held in Coinbase products
increased 9% Q/Q to $15 billion. Meanwhile, average off-platform USDC balances increased 12% Q/Q to $53
billion.
We believe Coinbase continues to be the best place to use stablecoins. USDC market capitalization increased
by approximately $12 billion from the end of Q2 to the end of Q3, and Coinbase customers accounted for the
largest portion of that balance growth. Our rewards program continued to drive USDC growth and adoption,
and we expanded the program to offer competitive rewards to our Institutional customers in Q3.

USDC in Coinbase Products 15 159

Blockchain rewards revenue was $185 million, up 28% Q/Q. Growth was primarily driven by the average prices
of ETH and SOL increasing 81% and 29%, respectively, in the quarter. Partially offsetting this was continued
decline to average rewards rates—an indicator of protocol maturity—which were down high single digits on
average for both ETH and SOL in Q3, as well as a slight decrease in SOL native units staked on our platform.
Interest and finance fee income was $65 million, up 9% Q/Q. Average loan balances across our institutional
financing products grew 25% Q/Q to reach a new all-time high of $1.2 billion in Q3, driven by an increasingly
diverse client base where we saw double digit growth in active customers in the quarter. We also saw growth in
interest income on custodial fiat in Q3 as average balances grew to $5.6 billion, partially offset by lower rates.
Other subscription and services revenue was $143 million, up 19% Q/Q driven by two primary factors:
• First, earn outs from ecosystem partners. As we work to drive crypto utility and build out the onchain
ecosystem, we may continue to partner with protocols to develop products in exchange for token earn
outs when certain milestones are reached. These payments can be significant depending on
performance, but are inherently episodic.
• Second, growth in Custodial fee revenue. Assets Under Custody grew to $300 billion as of the end of
Q3, another all-time high. We continued to see strong native unit inflows, in part due to our role as the
primary custodian for the vast majority of crypto ETFs. Additionally, asset prices (particularly BTC and
ETH) were a significant tailwind this quarter.
Expenses
Total Q3 operating expenses fell $134 million or 9% Q/Q to $1.4 billion. Technology & development, general &
administrative, and sales & marketing expenses collectively increased 14% Q/Q to $1.1 billion, largely driven
by growth in headcount and USDC rewards (in connection with growth of USDC balances in Coinbase
products); Deribit contributed $30 million (including $16 million of deal-related amortization). Full-time
employees increased 12% Q/Q to 4,795.

Q3 transaction expenses were $253 million, up 3% Q/Q, driven by an increase in blockchain rewards fees
given higher average asset prices in the quarter, and also increased customer trading activity in the quarter.
Offsetting this was lower rebates and commissions as we scaled back the incentives program in our derivatives
business.
Technology and development expenses were $431 million, up 11% Q/Q, primarily driven by an increase in
headcount, including personnel from Deribit. To a lesser extent, we also saw higher variable software spend
related to ongoing infrastructure projects and amortization of certain costs related to our acquisition of Deribit.
General and administrative expenses were $418 million, up 18% Q/Q. A majority of the quarterly cost growth
was driven by headcount as we expanded our customer service and global compliance efforts.
Sales and marketing expenses were $260 million, up 10% Q/Q. The two largest drivers of the increase were
certain amortization costs related to our acquisition of Deribit, and higher USDC rewards as average customer
USDC balances held in Coinbase products reached an all-time high of $15.0 billion in Q3.
Other operating expenses were $61 million, down 80% Q/Q. This included $48 million related to the data theft
incident disclosed in May, which included voluntary customer reimbursements and direct legal costs. As a
reminder, in Q2, we recognized $307 million of expenses for the same.
Stock-based compensation expense was $222 million, up 13% Q/Q, and in-line with our outlook.
Our effective tax rate in Q3 was 14%. Our tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due
to deductible stock-based compensation.
Net income in Q3 was $433 million. Adjusted Net Income was $421 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $801
million.
Share Count
Our weighted average fully diluted share count for Q3 was 292 million (including 263 million common shares
and 29 million dilutive shares), an increase of 13 million or 5% Q/Q. In Q3, we closed the acquisition of Deribit
which included consideration of nearly 11 million shares of Class A common stock.
Capital and Liquidity
At the end of Q3, we had $11.9 billion in $USD resources, increasing $2.6 billion or 28% Q/Q. The increase
was primarily driven by proceeds from our $3.0 billion convertible debt issuance in August, and an increase in
cash provided as a result of the increase in total revenue. Partially offsetting this was $688 million in cash

We consider our crypto assets held for investment and certain crypto assets held as collateral as other liquidity
resources available to us. In Q3, we increased our bitcoin holdings by $299 million, driven by weekly
purchases, for our crypto investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2025, the fair market value of our crypto
assets held for investment and our crypto assets held as collateral were $2.6 billion and $1.0 billion,
respectively. When including these crypto assets, total available resources totaled $15.5 billion.
Share Repurchase Program
In October 2024, our board of directors authorized and approved a share repurchase program, which provided
for the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding Class A common stock without expiration, and in
October 2025, our board of directors (i) increased the aggregate repurchase authorization under the program
from $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion and (ii) expanded the scope of the repurchases to include a portion of the
aggregate principal amount of our long-term debt. This program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar
amount or number of shares of Class A common stock or debt and may be modified, suspended, or
discontinued at any time.
Collateralized Arrangements & Financing and Counterparty Risk
We maintained our longstanding commitment to operating and risk excellence in Q3. At the end of Q3, we had
$1.1 billion in total credit and counterparty risk (excluding banks), stemming from $916 million in collateralized
loans to customers and $217 million held at third-party venues (including $111 million in unrestricted cash). As
a reminder, our loans require at least 100% in collateral (including recent facilities extended to BTC miners),
and are subject to rigorous risk monitoring.

Q4’25 Outlook
Coinbase Q4 2025 Outlook
METRIC OUTLOOK
Subscription and Services Revenue $710-$790 million
Mid-Teens as a percentage of net revenue
Transaction Expenses
Dependent on revenue mix
Technology & Development + $925-$975 million
General & Administrative Expenses Including ~$220 million in stock-based compensation
$215-$315 million
Sales and Marketing Expenses
Including ~$14 million in stock-based compensation
Transaction Revenue
We expect October transaction revenue to be approximately $385 million As always, we continue to urge
caution in extrapolating these results.
Subscription and Services Revenue
We expect Q4 subscription and services revenue to be within $710-$790 million. Our Q4 range reflects the
growth of both USDC market capitalization (which reached a new all-time high in October) and our Coinbase
One subscriber base, offset by market expectations of interest rate cuts.
Expenses
We expect technology & development and general & administrative expenses to be between $925-$975
million. Approximately half of the Q/Q increase is due to our acquisitions of Deribit and Echo; the remainder is
largely due to headcount, which we expect to grow at a slower rate in Q4 compared to Q3.
Sales and marketing expenses are expected to be in the range of $215-$315 million. Where we fall within the
range will largely be determined by (i) whether we continue to see attractive performance marketing
opportunities throughout the remainder of the year and (ii) USDC balances held in Coinbase products, which
drive USDC rewards.
Included within the expense outlook above is approximately $70 million of total depreciation and amortization
for Q4, reflecting an increase from historical averages driven by higher intangible amortization as a result of our
recent acquisitions.

Product Update Building the future of money, step by step
We see crypto adoption unfolding in 3 phases: people first invest through trading, then use financial services,
and ultimately engage with a rich app ecosystem. Coinbase is building for every step. We provide a trusted
venue for individuals and institutions to trade and custody assets, the first step in bringing people onchain. We
deliver financial services that put those assets to work, from staking, rewards, and spending, to powering
businesses. And we provide the infrastructure that lets this economy scale, with Base Chain for fast, low-cost
transactions, and USDC as a trusted digital dollar. This quarter, we continued advancing across all three
phases, staying focused on our mission to increase economic freedom worldwide.
Crypto as an Investment: We are building the most trusted, comprehensive venue to access, price, and
execute trades across spot and derivatives, and we’re expanding it in line with our Everything Exchange vision
to bring all tradable assets onto a single platform. In Q3, we executed on the foundations of that vision:
expanding tradable spot assets (including integrated DEX access), scaling U.S. perpetual futures, adding
global options with Deribit, and growing custody.
Spot & Simple Trading: Expanding Access to the Assets Users Want
• Adding more assets is consistently among the top requests from customers. In Q3, we added the
ability to trade more than 40 thousand assets in the Consumer app via our decentralized exchange
(DEX) integration on Base (powered by an integrated self-custody wallet), and we now support
approximately 90% of total crypto asset market capitalization for trading on our platform. We believe
DEX assets help turbocharge our centralized exchange (CEX) by surfacing early demand and price
discovery. When assets meet our standards, they will move to our CEX, where they should benefit
from deeper liquidity, faster execution.
Derivatives: Scaling a Durable, Global Business
• Derivatives account for ~80% of global crypto trading volume, yet the U.S. market makes up only a
fraction of this volume. This presents a significant growth opportunity, and one against which we saw
significant market share gains in Q3. In July, we launched first of its kind CFTC-regulated crypto
perpetual futures in the U.S., trading 24/7 with up to 10x intra-day leverage, and became the first U.S.
regulated futures exchange to offer 24/7 trading in BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP which together drove
our all-time high U.S. crypto derivatives market share.
• In August, we closed the Deribit acquisition, bringing the #1 crypto options exchange by volume and
open interest into Coinbase and creating the most comprehensive global crypto derivatives offering
across spot, futures, perpetuals, and options.
• We expanded our international derivatives total addressable market by adding new regulated routes
for growth and distribution in Brazil and India.
Custody at Scale: Coinbase as the Default Institutional Partner
• Assets Under Custody (AUC) reached an all-time high of $300 billion as did share of total crypto asset
market capitalization driven by strong inflows from ETFs and Corporate purchases.
• In October, we helped bring the first staking ETFs to the U.S. market with long-time partner Grayscale,
and continue to be the primary custodian for over 80% of U.S. BTC and ETH ETF assets as of
quarter-end.
Crypto as a Financial Service: Once assets are on Coinbase, the next step is utility. We're building trusted
products that help people use crypto the way they use money today, only faster, cheaper, and available 24/7. In

Q3, we made it simple to pay, earn, borrow, lend, and run businesses onchain. It’s how crypto starts to replace
and improve on traditional finance.
Financing: Powering Liquidity Across the Crypto Economy
• Institutional financing hit record highs with all-time high average loan balances and customer count
has achieved double-digit average quarterly growth over the past eight quarters, driven by corporates,
miners, market makers, and continued demand from hedge funds and asset managers.
• We launched cross-margining for institutional customers between U.S. futures on Coinbase
Derivatives Exchange (offered through Coinbase Financial Markets, our FCM) and spot on Coinbase
Exchange, delivering roughly 2x capital efficiency versus our nearest competitor in the U.S.
Building a Full-Stack Stablecoin Payments Platform
• We see payments as crypto’s next big use case, with stablecoins offering a new payments channel
enabling faster, cheaper, global transactions that are well suited for agentic commerce and micro
payments. In Q3, we took key steps toward that vision.
◦ Began rollout of Payment APIs and B2B payments UI/API, a single integration to embed
stablecoin checkout, send 24/7 payouts, automate treasury, open virtual accounts, and settle
in USDC on Base, backed by Coinbase security, liquidity, and distribution.
◦ Fully launched Embedded Wallets, enabling native, low-friction wallets inside apps to reduce
onboarding drop-off and eliminate app switching, so users can pay, earn, and hold value in-
app with instant USDC settlement on Base. When paired with our APIs, any app can go
onchain with one integration.
Coinbase One: Boosting Value and Increasing Options for Members
• We completed our rollout of Coinbase One Basic, our $4.99/month entry tier that delivers core
membership benefits like zero trading fees, boosted staking rewards, and access to exclusive onchain
partner offers. Early signals of traction have been promising. We’re also seeing significant interest
from international users.
• Coinbase One Card: Bringing Crypto Rewards to Fiat Payments
◦ As we scale crypto payments, we’re also meeting customers where they are with Coinbase
One Card, a traditional credit card issued by AmEx that offers up to 4.0% cash back in the
form of bitcoin rewards that provides a simple on-ramp for newcomers and added value for
existing users.
◦ Adoption is scaling, with more than $100 million in spend since launch, and everyday usage
is translating into platform engagement with CB1 card members depositing over $200 million
over the same period.

Crypto as an App Platform: The next chapter goes beyond financial services to a vibrant onchain app
ecosystem. It starts with Base Chain, a fast, low-cost L2 delivering sub-second, sub-cent transactions, paired
with stablecoins as trusted digital money for seamless payments. It comes to life in the Base App, the front
door to onchain where builders launch and users discover apps across trading, social, payments, messaging,
games, and more.
Scaling Base Chain: Fast, Cheap, Open, and Decentralized
• Network activity increased Q/Q, led by trading, social, payments, and lending apps. The ecosystem
now spans over 5 million tokens and 16 local-currency stablecoins.
• Flashblocks went live on mainnet, delivering ~200ms block times with sub-second, sub-cent
transactions, an important milestone in making the network even faster and cheaper.
• We introduced the Base and Solana bridge in testnet so people and builders can move assets
between the two networks more easily, with mainnet support coming in Q4.
Stablecoins: Trusted Onchain Money
• USDC market cap reached an all-time high of $74 billion in Q3. Market cap grew $12 billion from the
end of Q2 to the end of Q3, and Coinbase customers accounted for the largest portion of that balance
growth. USDC continues to outperform other major stablecoins with more than 2x YTD growth versus
the largest competitor.
• We believe Coinbase remains the best place to use stablecoins, with average USDC balances across
Coinbase products at $15 billion in Q3.
• We expect stablecoin adoption to continue to grow, propelled by the GENIUS Act passage,
strengthening institutional appetite, widening the pipeline with payment service providers, enterprises,
and banks.
Base App
• Base App entered beta in Q3, the onchain hub for trading, mini apps, social, chat, trading, and USDC
payments, bundled with Base Account (universal identity) and Base Pay (express USDC checkout).
While still early, we continue to see strong adoption.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDA
In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial performance measure, is useful information to help
investors evaluate our operating performance because it: enables investors to compare this measure and component adjustments to similar information provided by
peer companies and our past financial performance; provides additional company-specific adjustments for certain items that may be included in income from
operations but that we do not consider to be normal, recurring, operating expenses (or income) necessary to operate our business given our operations, revenue
generating activities, business strategy, industry, and regulatory environment; and provides investors with visibility to a measure management uses to evaluate our
ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. For example:
• We believe it is useful to exclude certain non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, from Adjusted
EBITDA because the amounts of such expenses can vary significantly from period to period and may not directly correlate to the underlying performance
of our business operations.
• We believe it is useful to exclude certain items that we do not consider to be normal, recurring, cash operating expenses and therefore, not reflective of our
ongoing business operations. For example, we exclude: (i) other expense (income), net, as the income and expenses recognized in this line item are not
part of our core operating activities and are considered non-operating activities under GAAP, (ii) gains and losses on crypto assets held for investment
because such investments are considered primarily long-term holdings, and (iii) losses directly related to the data theft incident announced on the Current
Report on Form 8-K we filed with the SEC on May 15, 2025 (the “Data Theft Incident”), including voluntary customer reimbursements, direct legal costs,
and reward payments, if any, in connection with the threat actor’s arrest and conviction. We do not plan on engaging in regular trading of crypto assets,
and, as an operating company, our investing activities in crypto are not part of our revenue generating activities, which are based on transactions on our
platform and the sales of subscriptions and services.
• We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation
expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, other expense (income), net, and provision for (benefit from) income taxes that can
vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired.
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share
In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share, both non-GAAP financial
performance measures, are useful information to help investors evaluate our operating performance. We believe it is useful to exclude tax-effected gains and losses
on crypto assets held for investment from both Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share because (i) such investments are considered primarily long-
term holdings, (ii) we do not plan on engaging in regular trading of crypto assets, and, (iii) as an operating company, our investing activities in crypto are not part of our
revenue generating activities, which are based on transactions on our platform and the sales of subscriptions and services. Additionally, we believe it is useful to
exclude tax-effected gains and losses on our marketable and strategic investments from Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share because such
investments are not part of our core operating activities and are considered non-operating activities under GAAP.
Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We believe that non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors for the reasons noted above. However, non-GAAP financial measures are presented for
supplemental informational purposes only, have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information
presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may
use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures as a tool for
comparison.
Adjusted EBITDA
There are a number of limitations related to Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income, which is the nearest GAAP equivalent of Adjusted EBITDA. Some of these
limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA excludes:
• provision for (benefit from) income taxes;
• interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces cash available to us;
• depreciation and amortization expense and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced
in the future;
13



## Page 15

• stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business
and an important part of our compensation strategy;
• losses directly related to the Data Theft Incident;
• net gains or losses on our crypto assets held for investment; and
• other expense (income), net, which represents net gains or losses on investments and other financial instruments, and other non-operating income and
expense activity.
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share
There are limitations related to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share rather than net income and net income per share, which are the nearest
GAAP equivalents, respectively, including that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share each exclude the tax-effected impact of our crypto investment
gains/losses and of our marketable and strategic investments gains/losses.
Additional Information
For more information, including reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP equivalents, please see the reconciliation of GAAP to
non-GAAP results tables in this shareholder letter. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measure and the reconciliations, and not to rely on
any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
