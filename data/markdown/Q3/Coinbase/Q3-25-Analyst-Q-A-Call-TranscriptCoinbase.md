Coinbase Global, Inc.
Third Quarter 2025 Analyst Q&A Call
October 30, 2025
Anil Gupta, Vice President, Investor Relations: Good afternoon and welcome to the Coinbase third quarter
2025 Analyst Q&A call. Joining me on today's call is Alesia Hass, CFO.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that during today's call, we may make forward-looking statements.
Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. Information concerning risks, uncertainties, and
other factors that could cause these results to differ is included in our SEC filings. Our discussion today will
also include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for GAAP measures.
And with that, let's take our first question.
Operator: To ask a question during this time press star followed by the number one. Each participant may ask
one question and one follow-up. Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of William Blair.
Andrew Jeffrey, William Blair: Hi, I appreciate you taking the question. I had a question around the stablecoin
revenue this quarter. I noticed that the yield on the off-platform USDC balances came down. I'm just wondering
if you could discuss what was driving that and how we may think about that going forward?
Alesia Haas, CFO: Good observation. So yes, we are pleased to see our record on-platform growth. Our
balance has now crossed $15 billion on average during the quarter. And notably, Circle is also focused on the
same. They are also focused on growing their on-platform via deals with other partners.
As we both are pursuing growth of on-platform balances, the mix will change over time, and the total available
off-platform dollars may decrease, and that is what we saw this quarter.
Andrew Jeffrey, William Blair: And that's just a mix function as to the other platform?
Alesia Haas, CFO: That's right. It's a mix of what is on versus off-platform. That's right.
Andrew Jeffrey, William Blair: And perhaps mix in between other distribution partners too? Or is it strictly on
versus off?
Alesia Haas, CFO: Correct. So if other distribution partners are incentivized and they're receiving on-platform
rewards, it will just shrink the overall off-platform.
Andrew Jeffrey, William Blair: I understand. And then just as a followup on the blockchain rewards, it's
wonderful to see the ecosystem mature, but is that a business that can grow over time as reward rates come
down?
Alesia Haas, CFO: So similar to Base, it's a volume versus rate question and we believe that as more and
more activity and transactions take place on proof of stake protocols and more and more assets are staked
that will grow the overall opportunity for the growth of blockchain rewards. However, the reward rates may
come down as we just get to more participation and more staking validators in the ecosystem.
So we are really pleased this quarter to see the first ETF get approved for staking and we are partnering with a
long-term partner Grayscale to offer staking within the ETF. So that is new assets that will become staked that
were not previously staked as an example. And so we think innovations like this will drive the total growth of
staked assets and we can be an important participant in that ecosystem.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Todaro of Needham & Company. Your line is open.

John Todaro, Needham: Hey, thanks for that. I guess two questions. First on tokenized real world assets, and
apologies if I missed this on a broader call, but where do you see kind of the economics accruing? Is it more so
in trading of these assets over time or is it Base Chain kind of underpinning some of them? Just kind of the
Coinbase thinking on tokenized real world assets.
Alesia Haas, CFO: So we are too early. We're obviously not monetizing today on this platform, but we believe
that we are uniquely enabled to provide infrastructure i.e. we have been safely custodying bearer instruments
now for the past 12 years. These will be tokenized. We do onchain transaction monitoring. We do onchain
network in Base.
And so we think we will monetize by being an infrastructure provider to this space. Early days in understanding
where value will accrue. I think as we're able to tokenize more and more assets there will be trading fees for
some of the more illiquid, longer tail of assets where we may just see less trading fees on things that are
already heavily commoditized and more liquid today.
John Todaro, Needham: Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up to that Grayscale ETF where you provide
the staking so you guys would be the exclusive staking provider for that or would there be a couple of
partners?
Alesia Haas, CFO: I don’t believe it’s exclusive in any way, and I do think due to their size and scale they have
the obligation to have redundancy, but we are one of their key partners and have been a long-standing majority
partner of theirs.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Markgraff of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is
open.
Alex Markgraff, KBCM: Thanks. Maybe just a quick followup on the liquidation event. Appreciate the
comments on the main call. Just to be clear, when we look at the October transaction revenue, is there
anything we should be thinking about or aware of with respect to that event? I think it was 385 that you all
called out around October.
Alesia Haas, CFO: There was a spike in volatility on October 10th that led to a lot of trading in and around the
day that there was a market dislocation. So yes, we had elevated single day trading. And this is why we share
with you crypto always has events that create short-term spikes in volatility and short-term spikes in trading. So
we don't overindex on any single day, week or month and don't look to extrapolate broadly.
But we also have now a full quarter of Deribit in that number, and options has shown to be less volatile than
many other asset classes in crypto, and seen that it is more durable during peaks and valleys in crypto prices.
Alex Markgraff, KBCM: Okay, thank you and then maybe just one more and I apologize. I know this is in a
transcript. I just haven't seen it yet. Your comments on 2026 opex, the sort of sequential thinking versus the
outlook you provided for 4Q, could you just restate that please?
Alesia Haas, CFO: Happy to. So what I shared is that in Q4, let's start there, that we are seeing sequential
growth in our Tech & Dev and G&A and at the midpoint of our range it's up about $100 million quarter over
quarter Q3 to Q4, and about half of that is driven by the acquisitions of Deribit and Echo.
And then the other half is driven by headcount growth. The growth rate in Q4 will be lower than our organic
headcount growth rate was in Q3. And then when I look forward to early 2026, my comments were “we're
planning to absorb the talent that we've brought on to the company in 2025.” We've really had 2025 be a
significant headcount growth year.
And as we turn the corner to 2026, we're really going to be focused on execution. And we anticipate that then
our sequential rate of operating expense growth, so the Q1 expense rate growth compared to Q4 will be much
slower than the growth rate you're seeing from Q3 to Q4. So that was our comment. So we're slowing the pace
of growth as we turn the corner into 2026.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Knoblauch of Cantor Fitzgerald.

## Page 3

Brett Knoblauch, Cantor Fitzgerald: Maybe just on the kind of trend or volume share dynamics kind of
underperformed global and the US which you guys attributed to reduced stablecoin trading. Is that a trade-off
that you're happy to make just because maybe stablecoin pairs are maybe a bit less profitable than your
traditional digital asset trading?
Alesia Haas, CFO: Yes, absolutely. And we shared this last quarter, we made a deliberate change to our
pricing program that increased the fees on stablecoin pairs. And that increase in fee was a deliberate act to
have less of that trading on our platform. What we observed is that because we are somewhat unique in the
ecosystem with really robust fiat on-ramps and off-ramps that other stablecoin participants do not have the
depth of the payment on-ramps and off-ramps, and we don't charge for those on-ramps and off-ramps that we
were finding some of that abused and we're offering that infrastructure for free to other players.
And so by increasing the fee, we are now charging for the use of our infrastructure to other stablecoins. And so
now it's a higher quality trading volume on our platform and we're getting paid appropriately for the cost of
operating services in this space.
I would note that this is only offered at higher fee tiers. So we are also very conscious that we don't want to
prohibit the growth of payments. And so if this is legitimate payments volume, we have different fee structures
than just trading volume that are looking for arbitrage and using the off-ramps for that purpose.
Brett Knoblauch, Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay, that makes sense. On Deribit and how that will kind of be
disclosed going forward. Will you guys continue to give Deribit revenue or I guess is it going to continue to be
lumped in institutional or will we have any sense of kind of backing out maybe like Deribit's take rate or I guess
how should we just be modeling Deribit on the go forward?
Alesia Haas, CFO: So, as I mentioned on the earlier call, we're really focused on monetization at the client
level versus at the product level at this point.
And so as we bring all of these products onto a single trading platform over time, the focus is growing total
trading revenue for institutional clients or total revenue for total Prime clients which includes trading, custody,
financing, etc. So we're looking at it more as the bundled growth of the institutional revenues that we have.
As things become material that would necessitate potentially additional breakouts. But in the near term, we are
not looking to focus on the growth of any single asset class category, options versus perps or spot versus
perps. We're looking to grow the overall trading activity on our platform. And so we will probably disclose most
of the data in aggregate. Notable that the fee rates for the institutional side are not as materially different as
they are between different retail products as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the Kareem Seif of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Kareem Seif, Bank of America: Good evening or afternoon everyone. Thank you so much for taking my
question. My first question is on the competitive landscape. So it was really nice that Coinbase didn't have to
really compete with Binance in the US. However, I think that they're looking to expand in the US. I believe that
they made a partnership with one asset manager. And so – my question is how could you defend your
business from the entry of the largest crypto exchange in the world into the US?
Alesia Haas, CFO: Binance had Binance.US for many years. So that's not a new entrant to the US market. I
think that there's a renewed push to the US is what I would characterize it but they've been a longstanding US
platform that we've competed against for the last four years or so. So, what I would say is just like everything
else that we welcome competition into this space because we think that that makes us all stronger. That makes
us have to really focus on product quality and competing to delight customers on our platform. But we've been
competing against a diverse group of players now for more than a decade and we're prepared for that
dynamic.
Kareem Seif, Bank of America: Got it. Thank you. And then for my follow up on the institutional adoption. So
obviously you guys called it on the call the partnership with Citi and you've made a partnership with JP Morgan
I believe in 2Q. So, I was wondering if you could kind of give us an update on the long-term opportunity to kind
3



## Page 4

of help TradFi expand their crypto offerings and could you maybe quantify for us the potential TAM or SAM and
how would the passage of the CLARITY Act help your business?
Alesia Haas, CFO: So two different kind of approaches there. One, we are the platform of choice when it
comes for TradFi, fintechs, big banks partnering to grow their products and services in crypto. And I think you
may have seen that time and time again where we partner with BlackRock, we partner with Shopify, we partner
with Citi and JP Morgan as you noted. So we're really proud that we've built a platform that has the institutional
scale, controls, complexity that can meet these large company and corporate needs and we think we're very
unique in that way. We also think this is a wonderful way to grow the overall crypto ecosystem as these are
large players with large distribution, big balance sheets, product complexity.
But I think it also speaks to the maturation of crypto where they are being driven each and their own right by
their own customers to gain access to crypto related products and services. And so we do think we're unique in
being able to serve them through our crypto as a service or our business products where they are building off
of the infrastructure that we have built.
So over time we think this is a wonderful complement to our own business where we go direct to consumer
that we are powering the ecosystem by being a key infrastructure provider so that others can go directly to
their clients and I think that that trend will continue because customers want this. We have 50 million
Americans holding crypto and I think that now a lot of companies that serve those customers are realizing they
want to serve their customer base in this way as well.
And with regards to the CLARITY Act, we've been pushing for crypto regulation now for some time and as you
know, we were pushing historically for it through Congress and the courts and now we're pushing through
Congress and the financial services regulators. That door was previously closed, but now it's wide open. And
so what CLARITY provides is a firm legislative framework with the taxonomy of the assets where we would
have clarity on who regulates which assets, how to define each of these assets. And we think that just clear
rules, level playing field will really just continue to foster innovation and adoption much like the GENIUS Act
has really created innovation and adoption of payments. So, we're really looking forward to the passage of that
act.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler of Rosenblatt Securities.
Chris Brendler, Rosenblatt Securities: I apologize if this was asked before but did miss some of the call this
afternoon, and the question is—it seems like everything seems to boost faster in crypto than it does in the
traditional world, and even though we're in the early innings, it seems like, of the crypto journey, that the
question I'm getting a lot these days is—centralized exchanges and traditional financial institutions entering the
market and the outlook for retail commissions. As Coinbase sort of plans for the medium to long term, I'd love
to hear how you're thinking about what this landscape looks like and just given how fast it's changing. Thanks.
Alesia Haas, CFO: We've long held the position that as crypto trading becomes commoditized and that people
have comparable products at many platforms that we will see price compression and spread compression
within crypto trading. It is yet to be the case that we've seen that, but we definitely think that there is a future
where these spreads come down much like they had in other asset classes over time once you got to broad
distribution and competition. It's why we've been so focused on revenue diversification and we're really pleased
with the efforts that we've made to diversify our revenues over the last few years.
As we noted this quarter, our subscription services revenues nearly reached $750 million, hundreds of millions
more than they were when we went public and even multiples above where they were two years ago. So, we're
really working on developing a suite of products and services to serve our retail, our institutional, and our
developer clients, monetizing the whole wallet at each of those customers’ level. And I think that we're doing
well at that continued goal towards that. And that will kind of insulate us from any risk on the overall simple
trading fee rates.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Owen Lau of Clear Street.

## Page 5

Owen Lau, Clear Street: Alesia, could you please help us size the net trading revenue of DEX and perps in
the third quarter? And you also talk about scaling back some of the rebates and incentives for derivatives.
Could you please add more color on the potential impact to revenue in the future as well? Any more color
would be helpful. Thanks.
Alesia Haas, CFO: So I want to share how we think about DEX versus centralized exchange revenue. Let me
zoom out to that level. We are focused on growing overall retail trading volume on our platform, and whether it
comes from DEX, whether it comes from our central exchange, we're agnostic. We're charging fees on both of
those platforms. The purpose of integrating DEX into the Coinbase app so people can find and discover and
trade these assets is that we can give them the earliest access to these assets as possible and they can come
to our platform and explore and find new assets.
And when those assets gain traction, we may then bring them onto our centralized exchange, where they can
benefit from higher liquidity, lower latency in trades, more depth. So, it's really an ongoing funnel, but we don't
anticipate monetizing these as two different products or two different volume streams because we think about
this as a migration path towards being listed on the centralized exchange in many ways. And so, we're looking
at this as a combined trading volume.
So, we did see more trading and we do think that the DEX contributed to that because now more and more
customers can say, "I can do more of my trading at Coinbase. I don't have to go to one platform for one thing
and a different platform for another thing." And so, we're getting higher share wallet from customers because
they can do everything on one platform, but we're not going to be disclosing or looking at volume of them as
two separate channels.
And then the second question, how meaningfully will reducing rebates grow institutional transaction
profitability? It is meaningful in the way that we were essentially providing rebates to offset almost all the
revenue. So the revenue contribution from the international exchange has been nearly zero for the last few
quarters as we were building open interest and building liquidity in these products. And so as we reduce these,
we're getting to a higher net revenue contribution. Then the combination of the integration of the futures with
options and with spot, we really think is the next plateau that can really accelerate the revenue growth for the
institutional business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bo Pei of US Tiger.
Bo Pei, US Tiger: So, I have a couple questions on the Coinbase One credit card. What are the unit
economics here and do you expect this to grow to a meaningful revenue contributor in the future? And I guess
is the up to 4% BTC cashback program self-funded through interchange or subsidized as a user acquisition
tool?
Alesia Haas, CFO: Great questions. So, the Coinbase One credit card is intended to be a customer acquisition
and retention tool and is not looking to drive significant revenue on our platform. We do believe that the
program can be self-funding. So, it will not be a cost of doing business. Rather, it'll be relatively a break even
product with the purpose of growing as we mentioned and acquiring customers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Engel of Compass Point.
Edward Engel, Compass Point: In the shareholder letter, you talked about how token earnouts boosted your
third quarter revenue in the other subscription services line item. I'm just kind of curious, was this just an
abnormally high quarter for earnouts or are you expecting this to kind of be a one time thing and not go into the
4Q?
Alesia Haas, CFO: Great question. So we anticipate these to be episodic. So as we continue to grow onchain
partnerships and we distribute products through either our main app or we have partners on Base, we are
finding that we are getting token allocations from these partners and that we would then vest in these token
allocations when the products achieve certain milestones.
And so, one, I think this could become more frequent going forward that we have revenue from these as this
becomes a more important part of the partnerships as we grow overall distribution of DeFi. However, it will be
5



## Page 6

very episodic. So, this is not a run rate and you should view this as sort of a one-time for Q3. However, I don't
think it's a true one time, we'll never have it again. It's just going to be episodic revenue.
Ed Engel, Compass Point: Got it, thanks. And then, I think you guys recently changed the reward structure of
USDC held on Base, in terms of the APYs. I know you guys just changed it a couple weeks ago, but just
wondering have you seen any material changes in user behavior, whether it's more Coinbase One
subscriptions or change in on platform balances? Thanks.
Alesia Haas, CFO: We're running experiments to look at different reward rates with Coinbase One, outside
Coinbase One, as we mentioned earlier thinking about different overall relationship monetization models. But in
the spirit of these are experiments, we are going to focus on the pricing that will drive overall positive
economics for Coinbase, positive user experience and, growth in our users and revenue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aditi Balachandran of Citi. Your line is open.
Pete Christiansen, Citi: It's Pete Christensen. Sorry for the network connection issue before. Alesia, I want to
ask you about the so-called GENIUS Amendment which I know it's a controversial topic, but the amendment
that could change the way that rewards on stablecoins are passed through distribution partners and the
potential that could be banned on the RFIA framework. Just thinking how Coinbase is thinking about that
scenario and how it could potentially or be required to repurpose how stablecoin rewards are handled. Thank
you.
Alesia Haas, CFO: So I think it's important to say how important rewards are to our customers and we are
going to support our customers in trying to advocate strongly for their right to receive rewards on stablecoins
and participate in this overall ecosystem. I think it's important to share that, we saw bipartisan support to pass
the GENIUS Act. Brian was in DC most recently last week discussing any potential risk to the GENIUS Act
getting reopened with Senators and I don't think there's a ton of appetite to do so. But we are going to continue
to advocate for our customers and we think this was a decided issue and don't see a purpose in having this
relitigated.
Pete Christiansen, Citi: Appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Zachary Gun of FT Partners. Your line is open.
Zachary Gunn, FT Partners: Hey there, thanks for the question. I just want to ask a quick accounting question
on perpetual futures. Can you confirm – is that in consumer transaction or other transaction revenue? And then
just second question quickly – is that consumer transaction – I believe let me pull up the metric here, apologies
– consumer transaction volume came in a touch better than our expectations. I was just wondering because
you mentioned some of these aspects like DEX expansion, perpetual futures. Were there any of those that
drove outsized growth? I know you don't want to get into the business of breaking all that out, but just curious if
there are any callouts there. Thanks.
Alesia Haas, CFO: Great questions. Okay, so first of all, in trading volume metrics, trading volume is a spot
only metric which drives the majority of our revenue. We have not provided a separate derivatives volume
metric nor have we aggregated derivatives volume with spot volume in our key business metrics at this time.
However, on the revenue side, we are aggregating derivatives revenue along with spot revenue in both the
consumer and the institutional revenue.
So to the extent it is consumers or retail trading – perps in the US on our CFTC regulated exchange or if it's
institutions we break out that revenue and record them in consumer transaction revenue or institutional
transaction revenue, respectively.
Up until this quarter there was nothing material in those revenues because as we mentioned on the institutional
side we were doing a contra revenue for incentives and rebates. On the consumer side it just has not been
material as compared to the overall spot transaction revenue. So we have not provided any breakout.
Now, on the institutional side with the combination of Deribit, derivatives is a more material driver which is why
we broke out in part the impact of Deribit this quarter for you. And we will evaluate going forward what the
6



## Page 7

disclosures will be and how we want to think about the combined platform as derivative scales. Similarly, DEX
is not yet material.
I would say the combination of everything though, the ability for our retail customers to trade more things on
our platform drove overall trading volume. And so I think you should think about this as the product gets deeper
and wider, you'll see just growth in overall trading activity and therefore revenues.
Anil Gupta, Vice President, Investor Relations: We have one more question.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Hal Goetsche of B Riley Securities. Your line is open.
Hal Goetsche, B Riley Securities: I got a quick question on the payment volume for traditional maybe
consumer transactions where the goal is to reduce friction and maybe reduce fees compared to maybe
merchant discount fees that are in the two different percent range online and I was wondering if you could give
us a little color on what kind of volume you've done in those kind of payments for a typical retailer? What
they're growing at? What’s the average transaction size? And color you can give on that kind of penetration of
that working at this point would be very helpful you could share. Thanks.
Alesia Haas, CFO: So the focus of our payments products right now are on B2B payments, not at this time on
retail payments. We think that will come with time but as Brian shared in his earlier call a lot of the pain that
merchants feel is on cross border payments and so we're going after that cross border $40 trillion volume
annually. And B2B is 75% of that network.
So in that case we're really working with small and medium sized businesses as well as large companies, i.e.
we have the partnerships we mentioned with Shopify where the payment APIs are now live and they're doing
business with their merchants through these payment rails.
So, it's early days. I don't have any specific data to provide with you at this time on typical transaction size,
what the transactions look like. What we're focused on right now is onboarding businesses where we shared
we have a thousand businesses onboarding and they're kind of scaling up their transaction volume.
Hal Goetsche, B Riley Securities: So, if I could ask a follow up to that please, would that be more like hey,
we're trying to reduce cross border banking fees as opposed to point of sale transactions? Is that the best way
to say it at this point? Business to business, cross border transactions is really the focus right now?
Alesia Haas, CFO: That's the initial focus. That is correct.
Anil Gupta, Vice President, Investor Relations: All right, that's it for today. Thanks for joining us and we'll
talk to you again next quarter.
