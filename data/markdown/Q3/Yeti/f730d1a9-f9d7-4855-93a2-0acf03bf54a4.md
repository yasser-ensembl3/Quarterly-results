CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All
statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements include statements containing words such as “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “can,” “have,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “design,” “due,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “intend,” “likely,” “may,” “might,” “objective,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “potential,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,”
“would,” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operational performance or other events.
For example, all statements made relating to our expectations about our share repurchase program, expected market or macroeconomic conditions, the impacts of
tariffs, supply chain and manufacturing diversification efforts, other tariff mitigation strategies, estimated and projected costs, expenditures, and growth rates, plans
and objectives for future operations, growth, or initiatives, or strategies are forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and
uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that are expected and, therefore, you should not unduly rely on such statements. The risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include but are not limited
to: economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions; our ability to maintain and strengthen our brand and generate and maintain ongoing
demand and prices for our products; our ability to successfully design, develop and market new products; our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products
and our results of operations; our ability to effectively manage our growth and supply chain; our ability to expand into additional consumer markets, and our
success in doing so; the success of our international expansion plans; our ability to compete effectively in the outdoor and recreation market and protect our brand;
the level of customer spending for our products, which is sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors; our ability to attract and retain skilled
personnel and senior management, and to maintain the continued efforts of our management and key employees; our ability to protect our intellectual property;
claims by third parties that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights; our involvement in legal or regulatory proceedings or audits; product recalls,
warranty liability, product liability, or other claims against us; problems with, or loss of, our third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers, or an inability to
obtain raw materials; our ability to timely obtain shipments and deliver products; risks related to manufacturer concentrations; fluctuations in the cost and
availability of raw materials, equipment, labor, and transportation and subsequent manufacturing delays or increased costs; legal, regulatory, economic, political and
public health risks associated with international trade; adverse changes in international trade policies, tariffs and treaties, including increases in tariff rates and the
imposition of additional tariffs; the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations; our ability to appropriately address emerging environmental, social and
governance matters and meet our environmental, social and governance goals; our and our suppliers’ and partners’ ability to comply with applicable laws and
regulations; our relationships with our national, regional, and independent retail partners, who account for a significant portion of our sales; seasonal and quarterly
variations in our business; financial difficulties facing our retail partners; the impact of catastrophic events or failures of our information systems, including due to
cybersecurity incidents, on our operations and the operations of our manufacturing partners; the integration and use of artificial intelligence; our ability to raise
additional capital on acceptable terms; the impact of our indebtedness on our ability to invest in the ongoing needs of our business; impairment to our goodwill or
other intangible assets; changes in tax laws or unanticipated tax liabilities; changes to our estimates or judgments; our ability to successfully execute our share
repurchase program and its impact on stockholder value and the volatility of the price of our common stock; strategic transactions targeting us; the impact of
stockholder activism, takeover proposals, proxy contests or short sellers; disruptions or diversions of our management’s attention due to acquisitions or investments
in other companies; and the risks and uncertainties described in detail in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2024
and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, as such risk factors may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other
reports we file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
These forward-looking statements are made based upon detailed assumptions and reflect management’s current expectations and beliefs. While we believe that
these assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is
impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect actual results.
The forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-
looking statement as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

YETI HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Business
Headquartered in Austin, Texas, YETI Holdings, Inc. is a global designer, retailer, and distributor of innovative outdoor products. From coolers and drinkware
to bags and apparel, YETI products are built to meet the unique and varying needs of diverse outdoor pursuits, whether in the remote wilderness, at the beach, or
anywhere life takes you. We sell our products through our wholesale channel, including independent retailers and national and regional accounts across a wide
variety of end user markets, as well as through our direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channel, which includes our websites, YETI Authorized on the Amazon
Marketplace, our corporate sales program, and our retail stores. We operate in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and Asia.
The terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “YETI” and “the Company” as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to YETI Holdings, Inc. and
its subsidiaries.
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, our financial statements
reflect all normal and recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of our results of operations for the interim
periods. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The consolidated
balance sheet as of December 28, 2024 is derived from the audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year
ended December 28, 2024, which should be read in conjunction with these unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses during the reporting period and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
condensed consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be made with certainty. Estimates may change
as new events occur, when additional information becomes available and if our operating environment changes. Actual results could differ from our estimates.
Fiscal Year End
We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday closest in proximity to December 31, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length,
except during a 53-week year when the fourth quarter will be 14 weeks. Our fiscal year ending January 3, 2026 (“2025”) is a 53-week period. The first quarter of
our fiscal year 2025 ended on March 29, 2025, the second quarter ended on June 28, 2025, and the third quarter ended on September 27, 2025. Our fiscal year
ended December 28, 2024 (“2024”) was a 52-week period. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to our fiscal
years and the associated quarters, months, and periods of those fiscal years. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial results presented herein represent the
three and nine months ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are recorded net of estimated credit losses. Our allowance for credit losses was $0.7 million as of September 27, 2025 and $1.4 million as
of December 28, 2024, respectively.

Table of Contents
Inventory
Inventories are comprised primarily of finished goods and are carried at the lower of cost (primarily using weighted-average cost method) or market (net
realizable value). At September 27, 2025 and December 28, 2024, inventory reserves were $4.0 million and $6.1 million, respectively.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
For financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset, or pay to
transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of such data, fair value is estimated using internal
information consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction. In determining fair value, observable inputs reflect market data
obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions; preference is given to observable inputs. These two types of inputs
create the following fair value hierarchy:
Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-
derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
Level 3: Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.
Our financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and bank indebtedness. The carrying amount of cash, accounts
receivable, and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amount of our long-term bank
indebtedness approximates fair value based on Level 2 inputs since our senior secured credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) carries a variable interest rate that is
based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”).
Supplier Finance Program Obligations
We have a supplier finance program (“SFP”) with a financial institution which provides certain suppliers the option, at their sole discretion, to participate in the
program and sell their receivables due from us for early payment. Participating eligible suppliers negotiate the terms directly with the financial institution and we
have no involvement in establishing those terms nor are we a party to these agreements. Our payments associated with the invoices from the suppliers participating
in the SFP are made to the financial institution according to the original invoice. The outstanding payment obligations under the SFP recorded within accounts
payable in our condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 27, 2025 and December 28, 2024 were $72.8 million and $63.1 million, respectively.
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740):
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in this update are intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax
disclosures primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the ASU to determine its impact on our consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic
220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. The amendments in this update are intended to improve disclosures about an entity’s expenses and provide
detailed information about the types of expenses, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and depletion, in
commonly presented expense captions on the face of financial statements. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and
interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the ASU to determine its impact on our
related disclosures.

Table of Contents
In July 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-05, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses for Accounts Receivable and
Contract Assets. The amendments in this update provide entities with a practical expedient when estimating expected credit losses for current accounts receivable
and current contract assets accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This update is effective
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. We are
currently evaluating the ASU to determine the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In September 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-06, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Targeted Improvements to
the Accounting for Internal-Use Software. The amendments in this update are intended to modernize the accounting for internal-use software costs accounted for
under ASC Subtopic 350-40. The amendment removes all references to software development project stages and requires entities to start capitalizing software costs
when both of the following occur: (i) funding has been committed and management authorization has been granted, and (ii) it is probable the project will be
completed. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2027, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, with
early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the ASU to determine its impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
2. ACQUISITIONS
Mystery Ranch Acquisition
On February 2, 2024, we completed the acquisition of all of the equity interests of Mystery Ranch, LLC (“Mystery Ranch”), a designer and manufacturer of
durable load-bearing backpacks, bags, and pack accessories. The total purchase price consideration was $36.2 million, net of a working capital adjustment and cash
acquired of $2.1 million. We have integrated Mystery Ranch operations and products into our business to further expand our capabilities in our bags category. The
acquisition was funded with cash on hand.
We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, assets acquired and
liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation is complete and based upon valuation information available
to determine the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, including goodwill.
The following table summarizes the final amounts recorded for acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the acquisition date (in thousands):
Cash $ 2,051
Accounts receivable, net 4,332
Inventory(1) 17,414
Prepaid expenses and other current assets 3,299
Property and equipment 512
Operating lease right-of-use assets 1,087
Goodwill 18,014
Intangible assets 5,500
Total assets acquired 52,209
Current liabilities $ (13,240)
Non-current liabilities (753)
Total liabilities assumed (13,993)
Net assets acquired $ 38,216
_________________________
(1) Includes a $4.8 million step-up of inventory to fair value, which was expensed as the related inventory was sold.

Table of Contents
The goodwill recognized is attributable to the expansion of our backpack and bag offerings and expected synergies from integrating Mystery Ranch’s products
into our product portfolio. The goodwill will be deductible for income tax purposes. The intangible assets recognized consist of a tradename and customer
relationships and have useful lives which range from 8 to 15 years.
Pro forma results are not presented as the impact of this acquisition is not material to our consolidated financial results. The net sales and earnings impact of
this acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial results for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025.
Other Acquisitions
During the first quarter of 2024, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Butter Pat Industries, LLC (“Butter Pat”), a designer and manufacturer of cast
iron cookware. The acquisition of Butter Pat expanded our capabilities in the cookware category, as shown by the launch of our new YETI-branded Cast Iron Skillet
during the third quarter of 2024. This transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition and is not material to our consolidated financial statements.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, we acquired powered cooling technology patents for $32.5 million in cash to develop a unique powered cooler platform.
This transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition.
During the third quarter of 2025, we acquired certain assets, including designs, tooling, and intellectual property, related to the Helimix branded shaker bottle
for $38.0 million in cash. This transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. In connection with this acquisition, we recognized trademarks, patents, and
tooling for $26.2 million, $9.4 million, and $2.4 million, respectively. The acquired trademarks and patents are being amortized on a straight-line basis and have
weighted average useful lives of 15 and 9 years, respectively.
3. REVENUE
Contract Balances
Accounts receivable represent an unconditional right to receive consideration from a customer and are recorded at net invoiced amounts, less an estimated
allowance for credit losses.
Contract liabilities are recorded when the customer pays consideration before the transfer of a good to the customer and thus represent our obligation to transfer
the good to the customer at a future date. Our contract liabilities include advance cash deposits received from customers for certain customized product orders and
unredeemed gift card liabilities. As products are shipped and control transfers, we recognize contract liabilities as revenue.
During the second quarter of 2023, we began issuing gift cards as remedies in connection with a voluntary recall of certain products. We recognize sales from
gift cards as they are redeemed for products. Contract liabilities that represented unredeemed gift card liabilities were $3.3 million and $2.9 million as of
September 27, 2025 and December 28, 2024, respectively.
The following table provides information about accounts receivable and contract liabilities at the periods indicated (in thousands):
September 27, December 28,
2025 2024
Accounts receivable, net $ 157,431 $ 120,190
Contract liabilities $ (15,674) $ (10,462)
For the nine months ended September 27, 2025, we recognized $10.5 million of revenue that was previously included in the contract liability balance at the
beginning of the period.

5. LEASES
We lease certain retail locations, office space, distribution facilities, manufacturing space, and machinery and equipment. While the substantial majority of
these leases are operating leases, certain machinery and equipment agreements are finance leases. As of September 27, 2025, the initial lease terms of the various
leases range from one to 20 years. Right-of-use (“ROU”) lease assets and liabilities associated with leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not
recorded on the balance sheet.

7. INCOME TAXES
Income tax expense was $13.7 million and $17.8 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. The decrease in
income tax expense was primarily due to lower income before income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 27, 2025 was 26%
compared to 24% for the three months ended September 28, 2024. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 27, 2025 was unfavorably impacted
by lower income before income taxes and increased primarily due to the non-deductible portion of executive compensation and a lower tax benefit from our
foreign-derived intangible income deduction.
Income tax expense was $37.4 million and $41.2 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. The decrease in
income tax expense was primarily due to lower income before income taxes. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 was 26%
compared to 25% for the nine months ended September 28, 2024. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 was unfavorably impacted
by lower income before taxes and increased primarily due to the non-deductible portion of executive compensation.
Deferred tax liabilities were $12.9 million as of September 27, 2025 compared to deferred tax assets of $9.1 million as of December 28, 2024. Deferred tax
liabilities are presented in other liabilities on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development enacted model rules for a new global minimum tax framework, also known as Pillar Two, and
certain governments globally have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, legislation to address Pillar Two. For the nine months ended September 27, 2025, the
impact of Pillar Two on our consolidated financial statements was not material.
On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was enacted in the U.S. The OBBBA includes significant provisions, such as the permanent
extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, modifications to the international tax framework and the restoration of favorable tax
treatment for certain business provisions. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others implemented through
2027. The effects of the OBBBA were incorporated into our income tax provision for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 and there was no material impact
to our income tax expense for the third quarter of 2025. We will continue to evaluate the impacts of OBBBA and do not expect the OBBBA to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.
For interim periods, our income tax expense and resulting effective tax rate are based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate adjusted for the effects of
items required to be treated as discrete to the period, including changes in tax laws, changes in estimated exposures for uncertain tax positions, and other items.
8. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
We award stock-based compensation to employees and directors under our 2024 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (“2024 Plan”). The 2024 Plan was
approved by the Company’s stockholders in May 2024 and replaced the 2018 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2018 Plan”). No new awards have
been or will be granted under the 2018 Plan since the 2024 Plan was approved. The 2018 Plan replaced the 2012 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan, as
amended and restated on June 20, 2018 (the “2012 Plan”). No awards remain outstanding under the 2012 Plan. Awards outstanding under the 2018 Plan will
continue to remain outstanding according to their terms. Shares subject to stock awards granted under the 2018 Plan (a) that expire or terminate without being
exercised or (b) that are forfeited under an award, return to the 2024 Plan.
We recognized non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $11.1 million and $8.7 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025 and
September 28, 2024, respectively. For the nine months ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, we recognized non-cash stock-based compensation
expense of $32.4 million and $26.0 million, respectively. At September 27, 2025, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $61.7 million for all
stock-based compensation plans is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.

9. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income
per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities, which include dilutive stock options and other stock-based awards.
The following table sets forth the calculation of earnings per share and weighted-average common shares outstanding at the dates indicated (in thousands,
except per share data):
Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended
September 27, September 28, September 27, September 28,
2025 2024 2025 2024
Net income $ 39,400 $ 56,284 $ 107,160 $ 122,535
Weighted-average common shares outstanding—basic 80,396 84,707 81,909 85,285
Effect of dilutive securities 1,033 785 903 754
Weighted-average common shares outstanding—diluted 81,429 85,492 82,812 86,039
Earnings per share
Basic $ 0.49 $ 0.66 $ 1.31 $ 1.44
Diluted $ 0.48 $ 0.66 $ 1.29 $ 1.42
Effects of potentially dilutive securities are presented only in periods in which they are dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025,
outstanding stock-based awards representing 0.1 million and 0.9 million shares, respectively, of common stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted
earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. For each of the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, outstanding stock-based awards
representing less than 0.1 million shares of common stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings, because their effect would be anti-dilutive.
10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
On February 1, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of YETI’s common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”),
excluding fees, commissions, and excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

As part of the Share Repurchase Program, on February 27, 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “February ASR Agreement”)
with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) to repurchase $100.0 million of YETI’s common stock. Pursuant to the February ASR Agreement, we made a
payment of $100.0 million to Goldman Sachs and received an initial delivery of 1,998,501 shares of YETI’s common stock (the “February Initial Shares”),
representing 80% of the total shares that we expected to receive under the February ASR Agreement based on the market price of $40.03 per share at the time of
delivery of the February Initial Shares. The February ASR Agreement was accounted for as an equity transaction.
On April 25, 2024, we settled the transactions contemplated by the February ASR Agreement, resulting in a final delivery of 642,674 shares (the “February
Final Shares”). The total number of shares repurchased under the February ASR Agreement was 2,641,175 at an average cost per share of $37.86, based on the
volume-weighted average share price of YETI’s common stock during the calculation period under the February ASR Agreement.
As part of the Share Repurchase Program, on November 12, 2024, we entered into a second accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “November ASR
Agreement”) with Goldman Sachs to repurchase an additional $100.0 million of YETI’s common stock. Pursuant to the November ASR Agreement, we made a
payment of $100.0 million to Goldman Sachs and received an initial delivery of 1,933,301 shares of YETI’s common stock (the “November Initial Shares”),
representing 80% of the total shares that we expected to receive under the November ASR Agreement based on the market price of $41.38 per share at the time of
delivery of the November Initial Shares. The November ASR Agreement was accounted for as an equity transaction. The fair value of the November Initial Shares
of $80.0 million was recorded as a treasury stock transaction. The remaining $20.0 million was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.
On January 6, 2025, we settled the transactions contemplated by the November ASR Agreement, resulting in a final delivery of 551,955 shares (the “November
Final Shares”). The total number of shares repurchased under the November ASR Agreement was 2,485,256 at an average cost per share of $40.24, based on the
volume-weighted average share price of YETI’s common stock during the calculation period under the November ASR Agreement.
At the time they each were received, the initial share deliveries and the final share deliveries related to the February ASR Agreement and the November ASR
Agreement resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares calculation for basic and diluted
earnings per share.
During the first quarter of 2025, our Board of Directors approved a $350.0 million increase to the Share Repurchase Program authorization, for a total of
$450.0 million available under the Share Repurchase Program. Repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program may be made from time to time at prevailing
prices in the open market, through various methods, including, but not limited to, open market, privately negotiated, or accelerated share repurchase transactions.
Repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program may also be made pursuant to a plan adopted under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
During the second quarter of 2025, we repurchased 744,572 shares of YETI’s common stock on the open market for approximately $23.0 million, at an average
repurchase price of $30.85 per share. The repurchased common stock is held as treasury stock.
During the third quarter of 2025, we repurchased 4,278,800 shares of YETI’s common stock on the open market for approximately $150.0 million, at an
average repurchase price of $35.02 per share. The repurchased common stock is held as treasury stock.
In total, we repurchased 5,023,372 shares of YETI’s common stock on the open market for approximately $172.8 million, at an average repurchase price of
$34.41 per share, during the nine months ended September 27, 2025.
11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Claims and Legal Proceedings
We are involved in various claims and legal proceedings, some of which are covered by insurance. We believe that our existing claims and proceedings, and the
potential losses relating to such contingencies, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and should be read in conjunction
with the disclosures we make concerning risks and other factors that may affect our business and operating results, including those described in more detail in Part I
“Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2024 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed
with the SEC. The information contained in this section should also be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the
information contained elsewhere in this Report. See also “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” immediately prior to Part I, Item I in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “YETI,” and “the Company” as used herein, and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to YETI Holdings, Inc. and
its subsidiaries.
Business Overview
Headquartered in Austin, Texas, YETI is a global designer, retailer, and distributor of innovative outdoor products. From coolers and drinkware to bags and
apparel, YETI products are built to meet the unique and varying needs of diverse outdoor pursuits, whether in the remote wilderness, at the beach, or anywhere life
takes you. By consistently delivering high-performing, exceptional products, we have built a strong following of brand loyalists throughout the world, ranging from
serious outdoor enthusiasts to individuals who simply value products of uncompromising quality and design. We have an unwavering commitment to outdoor and
recreation communities, and we are relentless in our pursuit of building superior products for people to confidently enjoy life outdoors and beyond.
We distribute our products through a balanced omni-channel platform, consisting of our wholesale and direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channels. In our wholesale
channel, we sell our products through select national and regional accounts and an assemblage of independent retail partners throughout the United States, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and Japan, among others. We carefully evaluate and select retail partners that have an image and approach that are consistent with
our premium brand and pricing. Our domestic national and regional specialty retailers include Dick’s Sporting Goods, REI, Academy Sports + Outdoors, Bass Pro
Shops, Ace Hardware, Scheels, and Tractor Supply Company. We sell our products in our DTC channel to customers through our websites and YETI Authorized on
the Amazon Marketplace, as well as in our retail stores. Additionally, we offer customized products with licensed marks and original artwork primarily through our
DTC channel, including our corporate sales channel, on our websites, and at select retail stores. Our corporate sales program offers customized products to
corporate customers for a wide-range of events and activities and in certain instances may also offer products to re-sell.
Product Introductions and Updates
During the first quarter of 2025, we expanded our bag offerings with the launch of the new Ranchero backpack in two sizes and introduced new seasonal
colorways across our Drinkware and Coolers & Equipment categories.
During the second quarter of 2025, we expanded our Drinkware category with the launch of the Rambler Travel Bottle in two sizes and introduced the
redesigned and improved Rambler Jug in two sizes. We continued the expansion of our outdoor kitchen offerings with the launch of the Rambler Insulated Bowls in
six sizes and the 14” Cast Iron Skillet. In our Coolers & Equipment category, we expanded our hard cooler offerings with the redesigned Roadie 24, the new Hondo
Beach Chair, and the limited release Can Crusher. We continued the expansion of our bag offerings with the launch of the new Cayo backpack in two sizes and two
new sizes of the Ranchero backpack. In our bag offerings, we also introduced the Daytrip collection, which includes the Daytrip Lunchboxes in two sizes, the
Daytrip Lunch Bag, and the Daytrip Tote Bag. We also introduced new seasonal colorways across our Drinkware and Coolers & Equipment categories.
During the third quarter of 2025, we expanded our Drinkware category with the launch of the Rambler Ceramic Mug Collection in two sizes and introduced a
new size of the Rambler Travel Bottle. We continued the expansion of our outdoor kitchen offerings with the launch of the Rambler Food Jars in two sizes. In our
Coolers & Equipment category, we expanded our bags offerings with the introduction of a new size of the Cayo backpack. We also introduced new seasonal

Macroeconomic Conditions
Our business is exposed to and impacted by macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to uncertainty surrounding inflationary pressures, consumer
confidence and purchasing behaviors, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, geopolitical conflicts, and government actions and policies, including changes in
interest rates, tax rates, and tariff rates. We have experienced a challenging macroeconomic and consumer spending environment through the third quarter of 2025
and expect such challenges to continue through the remainder of 2025.
During 2025, the United States implemented incremental tariffs on imports from many countries. Most of our products are produced in countries that are
subject to these tariffs. As a result, the cost to import our products into the U.S. has increased. These increased costs have had a material negative impact on our
gross margins and results of operations in 2025. If current tariff levels persist or worsen, we expect that tariffs will continue to have a negative impact on our gross
margins and results of operations.
We have been, and will continue, pursuing strategic options to mitigate the impact of tariffs. For example, in response to the elevated tariffs on imports from
China announced earlier this year, we have continued our efforts to accelerate the diversification of our Drinkware manufacturing to additional countries beyond
China. We continue to expect a large percentage of our Drinkware manufacturing capacity to be outside of China by the end of 2025. These accelerated
diversification efforts have caused short-term supply chain disruptions, which have impacted our ability to source certain products. As a result, we have experienced
inventory constraints that have adversely impacted sales in 2025, and we expect such impact to continue in the fourth quarter of 2025.
In addition to diversifying Drinkware manufacturing beyond China, to mitigate the impact of tariffs we are also managing operating expenses, working capital
and cash; negotiating with suppliers; evaluating pricing strategies; leveraging tariff exemptions where possible; and pursuing other supply chain optimization
activities.
General
Components of Our Results of Operations
Net Sales. Net sales are comprised of wholesale channel sales to our retail partners and sales through our DTC channel. Net sales in both channels reflect the
impact of product returns as well as discounts for certain sales programs or promotions.
We discuss the net sales of our products in our two primary categories: Coolers & Equipment and Drinkware. Our Coolers & Equipment category includes hard
coolers, soft coolers, bags, outdoor equipment, and cargo, as well as accessories and replacement parts for these products. Our Drinkware category is primarily
composed of our stainless-steel drinkware products and related accessories. In addition, our Other category is primarily comprised of ice substitutes and YETI-
branded gear, such as shirts, hats, and other miscellaneous products.
Gross profit. Gross profit reflects net sales less cost of goods sold, which primarily includes the purchase cost of our products from our third-party contract
manufacturers, inbound freight and duties, product quality testing and inspection costs, depreciation expense of our molds, tooling, and equipment, and the cost of
customizing products. We calculate gross margin as gross profit divided by net sales. Our DTC channel generally generates higher gross margin than our wholesale
channel due to differentiated pricing between these channels.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consist primarily of marketing costs, employee
compensation and benefits costs, including non-cash stock-based compensation, distribution and fulfillment costs, depreciation and amortization expense, and
general and administrative expenses. Our distribution and fulfillment costs include costs of our third-party warehousing and logistics operations, outbound freight
costs, costs of operating on third-party DTC marketplaces, and credit card processing fees. Certain distribution and fulfillment costs will vary as they are dependent
on our sales volume and our channel mix. Our DTC channel variable SG&A costs are generally higher as a percentage of net sales than our wholesale channel
distribution costs.

Fiscal Year. We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday closest in proximity to December 31, such that each quarterly period will be
13 weeks in length, except during a 53-week year when the fourth quarter will be 14 weeks. Our fiscal year ending January 3, 2026 (“2025”) is a 53-week period.
The first quarter of our fiscal year 2025 ended on March 29, 2025, the second quarter ended on June 28, 2025, and the third quarter ended on September 27, 2025.
Our fiscal year ended December 28, 2024 (“2024”) was a 52-week period. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer
to our fiscal years and the associated quarters, months, and periods of those fiscal years. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial results presented herein

with recall remedies.
Net sales in our channels were as follows:
• DTC channel net sales increased $7.9 million, or 3%, to $288.7 million, compared to $280.8 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to growth in
our Amazon Marketplace business, Corporate Sales and YETI retail stores, partially offset by a decline in sales on our U.S. YETI website. DTC channel
mix was 59% for both the third quarters of 2025 and 2024.

• Wholesale channel net sales increased $1.4 million, or 1%, to $199.0 million, compared to $197.6 million in the same period last year, primarily due to
growth in Coolers & Equipment.
Net sales in our two primary product categories were as follows:
• Drinkware net sales decreased by $11.2 million, or 4%, to $263.8 million, compared to $275.0 million in the prior year quarter. Drinkware growth in our
international regions was more than offset by a decline in our U.S. region, reflecting a promotional market environment and inventory constraints driven
by our supply chain transition in the current year quarter.
• Coolers & Equipment net sales increased by $22.8 million, or 12%, to $215.4 million, compared to $192.6 million in the same period last year, primarily
driven by strong performance in soft coolers and bags.
Net sales in the U.S. decreased $2.8 million, or 1%, to $387.3 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025. Net sales in international locations
increased $12.2 million, or 14%, to $100.4 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025 reflecting growth across all regions, led by Europe and Australia,
as well as Japan, which launched in the second quarter of 2025. Net sales in international locations represented 21% and 18% of total net sales in the third quarter of
2025 and 2024, respectively.
Gross Profit
Gross profit decreased $5.2 million, or 2%, to $272.5 million, compared to $277.7 million in the prior year quarter. Gross margin rate decreased 210 basis
points to 55.9% from 58.0% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the following factors:
• higher tariff costs, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 320 basis points; and
• a decrease in the mix of Drinkware net sales, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 80 basis points.
These were partially offset by:
• lower product costs, which favorably impacted gross margin by 60 basis points;
• the impact of selective price increases on certain drinkware products implemented during the second quarter of 2025, which favorably impacted gross
margin by 50 basis points;
• lower inbound freight, which favorably impacted gross margin by 30 basis points;
• the absence in the current year quarter of the amortization of inventory fair value step-up in connection with the Mystery Ranch acquisition, which
favorably impacted gross margin by 20 basis points; and
• other impacts, which favorably impacted gross margin by 30 basis points.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses
SG&A expenses increased $10.1 million, or 5%, to $218.2 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025, compared to $208.1 million for the three
months ended September 28, 2024. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 120 basis points to 44.7% from 43.5% in the prior year quarter. The
increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by:
• an increase in general and administrative expenses of $6.2 million (increasing SG&A as a percent of sales by 110 basis points) mainly due to growth
investments in technology and facilities as well as asset impairments in the current year quarter;
• an increase in employee compensation and benefits expenses of $3.1 million (increasing SG&A as a percent of sales by 40 basis points) primarily due to
an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense;
• an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $1.9 million (increasing SG&A as a percent of sales by 40 basis points) primarily related to our
continued capital investments; and
• an increase in distribution and fulfillment expenses of $0.9 million (decreasing SG&A as a percent of sales by 10 basis points) primarily due to higher
third-party logistics fees and higher online marketplace fees associated with higher Amazon Marketplace net sales, partially offset by lower outbound
freight expenses.
The increases in SG&A expenses were partially offset by lower marketing and advertising expenses of $2.0 million (decreasing SG&A as a percent of sales by
60 basis points).

Non-Operating Expenses
Interest expense, net was $0.1 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025. Interest income, net was $0.4 million for the three months ended
September 28, 2024. The change versus the prior year quarter was primarily due to a decrease in interest income.
Other expense was $1.2 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025. Other income was $4.1 million for the three months ended September 28,
2024. The change versus the prior year quarter was primarily due to foreign currency losses on intercompany balances for the three months ended September 27,
2025 versus foreign currency gains on intercompany balances for the three months ended September 28, 2024.
Income tax expense was $13.7 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025, compared to $17.8 million for the three months ended September 28,
2024. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to lower income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 26% for the three months ended
September 27, 2025, compared to 24% for the three months ended September 28, 2024. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 27, 2025 was
unfavorably impacted by lower income before taxes and increased primarily due to the non-deductible portion of executive compensation and a lower tax benefit
from our foreign-derived intangible income deduction.

Net Sales
Net sales increased $1.5 million to $1,284.8 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2025, compared to $1,283.3 million for the nine months ended
September 28, 2024. Net sales for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 included $5.1 million and $7.1 million, respectively, of sales
related to gift card redemptions in connection with recall remedies.
Net sales in our two channels were as follows:
• DTC channel net sales increased $14.5 million, or 2%, to $733.5 million, compared to $719.0 million in the prior year period, primarily due to growth in
our Amazon Marketplace business, Corporate Sales and YETI retail stores, partially offset by a decline in sales on our U.S. YETI website. DTC channel
mix was 57% and 56% for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively.
• Wholesale channel net sales decreased $13.1 million, or 2%, to $551.3 million, compared to $564.3 million in the same period last year, primarily due to a
decline in Drinkware, partially offset by growth in Coolers & Equipment.
Net sales in our two primary product categories were as follows:
• Drinkware net sales decreased by $30.3 million, or 4%, to $705.8 million, compared to $736.1 million in the prior year period. Drinkware growth in our
international regions was more than offset by a decline in our U.S. region, reflecting a promotional market environment and inventory constraints driven
by our supply chain transition in the current year period.
• Coolers & Equipment net sales increased by $37.7 million, or 7%, to $556.2 million, compared to $518.4 million in the same period last year, primarily
driven by strong performance in bags, soft coolers, and hard coolers.
Net sales in the U.S. decreased $26.5 million, or 3%, to $1,026.4 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2025. Net sales in international locations
increased $27.9 million, or 12%, to $258.4 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 reflecting growth across all regions, led by Europe and Canada,
as well as Japan, which launched in the second quarter of

2025. Net sales in international locations represented 20% and 18% of total net sales in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Gross Profit
Gross profit decreased $5.0 million to $731.8 million compared to $736.8 million in the prior year period. Gross margin rate decreased 40 basis points to
57.0% from 57.4% in the same period last year, primarily due to the following factors:
• higher tariff costs, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 190 basis points;
• a decrease in the mix of Drinkware net sales, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 60 basis points; and
• the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 10 basis points.
These were partially offset by:
• lower product costs, which favorably impacted gross margin by 90 basis points;
• the absence in the current year quarter of the amortization of inventory fair value step-up in connection with the Mystery Ranch acquisition, which
favorably impacted gross margin by 50 basis points;
• the impact of selective price increases on certain drinkware products implemented during the second quarter of 2025, which favorably impacted gross
margin by 40 basis points;
• lower inbound freight, which favorably impacted gross margin by 20 basis points; and
• other impacts, which favorably impacted gross margin by 20 basis points.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses
SG&A expenses increased by $19.8 million, or 3%, to $593.8 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 compared to $574.0 million for the nine
months ended September 28, 2024. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased by 150 basis points to 46.2% for the nine months ended September 27,
2025 compared to 44.7% for the nine months ended September 28, 2024. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by:
• an increase in general and administrative expenses of $15.8 million (increasing SG&A as a percent of sales by 130 basis points) mainly due to growth
investments in technology and facilities as well as higher advisory and legal fees;
• an increase in employee compensation and benefits expenses of $6.3 million (increasing SG&A as a percent of sales by 40 basis points) primarily due to
an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense; and
• an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $3.6 million (increasing SG&A as a percent of sales by 30 basis points) primarily related to our
continued capital investments.
The increases in SG&A expenses were partially offset by:
• a decrease in distribution and fulfillment expenses of $3.7 million (decreasing SG&A as a percent of sales by 30 basis points) mainly due to lower
outbound freight fees, partially offset by higher third-party logistics fees and higher online marketplace fees associated with higher Amazon Marketplace
net sales; and
• a decrease in marketing and advertising expenses of $2.3 million (decreasing SG&A as a percent of sales by 20 basis points).
Non-Operating Expenses
Interest income, net was $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2025. Interest income, net was $0.5 million for the nine months ended
September 28, 2024. The change versus the prior year quarter was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in interest income.
Other income was $6.0 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2025, compared to other income of $0.4 million for the nine months ended
September 28, 2024. The change versus the prior year period was primarily due to higher foreign currency gains on intercompany balances.

Income tax expense was $37.4 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2025, compared to $41.2 million for the nine months ended September 28,
2024. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to lower income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 26% for the nine months ended
September 27, 2025 compared to 25% for the nine months ended September 28, 2024. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 was
unfavorably impacted by lower income before taxes and increased primarily due to the non-deductible portion of executive compensation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
Our cash requirements have principally been for working capital purposes, long-term debt repayments, and capital expenditures. We fund our working capital
and our capital investments from cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand, and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility (the “Revolving
Credit Facility”). Pursuant to our Share Repurchase Program described below, we may also use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. We believe that our
current operating performance, operating plan, strong cash position, and borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our
liquidity needs and cash requirements for at least the next twelve months and foreseeable future.
Current Liquidity
As of September 27, 2025, we had a cash balance of $164.5 million, working capital (excluding cash) of $210.2 million, and $300.0 million of borrowings
available under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Credit Facility
Our Credit Facility provides for a $300.0 million Revolving Credit Facility and an $84.4 million term loan (the “Term Loan A”).
At September 27, 2025, we had $74.9 million principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Term Loan A under the Credit Facility and no
outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The weighted-average interest rate for borrowings under the Term Loan A was 6.15% during the three
months ended September 27, 2025.
The Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain covenants, including financial covenants regarding our total net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio.
Fluctuations in these ratios may increase our interest expense. Failure to comply with these covenants and certain other provisions of the Credit Facility, or the
occurrence of a change of control, could result in an event of default and an acceleration of our obligations under the Credit Facility or other indebtedness that we
may incur in the future. At September 27, 2025, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under the Credit
Facility.
Share Repurchase Program
On February 1, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of YETI’s common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”),
excluding fees, commissions, and excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
As part of the Share Repurchase Program, on February 27, 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “February ASR Agreement”)
with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) to repurchase $100.0 million of YETI’s common stock. Pursuant to the February ASR Agreement, we made a
payment of $100.0 million to Goldman Sachs and received an initial delivery of 1,998,501 shares of our common stock. We received a final delivery of an
additional 642,674 shares on April 25, 2024. The February ASR Agreement resulted in the total repurchase of 2,641,175 shares.
In addition, as part of the Share Repurchase Program, on November 12, 2024, we entered into a second accelerated share repurchase agreement (the
“November ASR Agreement”) with Goldman Sachs to repurchase an additional $100.0 million of YETI’s common stock. Pursuant to the November ASR
Agreement, we made a payment of $100.0 million to Goldman Sachs and received an initial delivery of 1,933,301 shares of YETI’s common stock. We received a
final delivery of an additional 551,955 shares on January 6, 2025. The November ASR resulted in the total repurchase of 2,485,256 shares.

During the first quarter of 2025, our Board of Directors approved a $350.0 million increase to the Share Repurchase Program authorization, for a total of
$450.0 million available under the Share Repurchase Program. Repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program may be made from time to time at prevailing
prices in the open market, through various methods, including, but not limited to, open market, privately negotiated, or accelerated share repurchase transactions.
Repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program may also be made pursuant to a plan adopted under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The timing, manner, price, and actual amount of share repurchases will be determined by management based on various
factors, including, but not limited to, stock price, economic and market conditions, other capital allocation needs and opportunities, and corporate and regulatory
considerations. YETI has no obligation to repurchase any amount of our common stock, and such repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
During the second quarter of 2025, we repurchased 744,572 shares of YETI’s common stock on the open market for approximately $23.0 million, at an average
repurchase price of $30.85 per share. The repurchased common stock is held as treasury stock.
During the third quarter of 2025, we repurchased 4,278,800 shares of YETI’s common stock on the open market for approximately $150.0 million, at an
average repurchase price of $35.02 per share. The repurchased common stock is held as treasury stock.
In total, we repurchased 5,023,372 shares of YETI’s common stock on the open market for approximately $172.8 million, at an average repurchase price of
$34.41 per share, during the nine months ended September 27, 2025.
Material Cash Requirements
There have been no material changes in our material cash requirements for contractual and other obligations compared to the disclosures included under
“Material Cash Requirements” included in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2024 filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Cash Flows from Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities
The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated (in thousands):
Nine Months Ended
September 27, September 28,
2025 2024
Cash flows provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 81,839 $ 35,806
Investing activities $ (81,242) $ (87,047)
Financing activities $ (194,192) $ (107,517)
Operating Activities
Cash flows related to operating activities are dependent on net income, non-cash adjustments to net income, and changes in working capital. The increase in
cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 27, 2025 compared to cash provided by operating activities during the nine months
ended September 28, 2024 is primarily due to a decrease in cash used in working capital driven by a decrease in cash used in the changes of accounts payable and
accrued expenses and accounts receivable balances.
Investing Activities
The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 27, 2025 was primarily due to lower purchases of property and
equipment, and lower cash paid for acquisitions in the current year period.
Financing Activities
The increase in cash used by financing activities during the nine months ended September 27, 2025 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock
compared to the prior year period.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on our results of
operations and financial condition, see “Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures.
We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to
be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. A discussion of the accounting policies that management
considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments and assumptions require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because
they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results is included in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 28, 2024 filed with the SEC.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
There have been no material changes to our market risk exposures or management of market risk from those disclosed in Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk included under Item 7A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2024.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange
Act”)) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding
disclosures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 27, 2025.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the quarter ended September 27, 2025, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations in Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures, or our
internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake or fraud. Additionally, controls can be circumvented
by individuals or groups of persons or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system,
misstatements in our public reports due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
We are involved in various claims and legal proceedings, some of which are covered by insurance. We believe that our existing claims and proceedings are not
material.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors contained in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 28, 2024.
Adverse changes in international trade policies, tariffs and treaties, including increases in tariff rates and the imposition of additional tariffs, may
materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Most of our imported products are subject to tariffs, duties, indirect taxes, quotas and non-tariff trade barriers, any of which may limit the quantity of products
that we may import into the United States and other countries or that may impact the cost of such products. To maximize opportunities, we rely on free trade
agreements and other supply chain initiatives, and, as a result, we are subject to government regulations and restrictions with respect to our cross-border activity.
Additionally, we are subject to government regulations relating to importation activities, including related to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) withhold
release orders. The imposition of taxes, duties and quotas, the withdrawal from or the material modification to trade agreements, retaliatory actions from other
countries, and/or if CBP detains shipments of our goods pursuant to a withhold release order could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.
During 2025, the United States implemented incremental tariffs on imports from many countries. Most of our products are produced in countries that are
subject to these tariffs. As a result, the cost to import our products into the U.S. has increased. These increased costs have had a material negative impact on our
gross margins and results of operations in 2025. If current tariff levels persist or worsen, we expect that tariffs will continue to have a negative impact on our gross
margins and results of operations.
We have been, and will continue, pursuing strategic options to mitigate the impact of tariffs. For example, in response to the elevated tariffs on imports from
China announced earlier this year, we have continued our efforts to accelerate the diversification of our Drinkware manufacturing to additional countries beyond
China. We continue to expect a large percentage of our Drinkware manufacturing capacity to be outside of China by the end of 2025. These accelerated
diversification efforts have caused short-term supply chain disruptions, which have impacted our ability to source certain products. As a result, we have experienced
inventory constraints that have adversely impacted sales in 2025, and we expect such impact to continue in the fourth quarter of 2025. If we do not meet demand
due to constrained inventory, we could damage our relationships with our wholesale partners and customers and delay or lose sales opportunities, which could
unfavorably impact our future sales and materially negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, a change in available exemptions, an increase in tariffs
in other countries, or retaliatory actions from other countries, could further constrain our supply chain and further raise the cost of our products.
In addition to diversifying Drinkware manufacturing beyond China, we are managing operating expenses, working capital and cash; negotiating with suppliers;
evaluating pricing strategies; leveraging tariff exemptions where possible; and pursuing other supply chain optimization activities.
Tariffs have potential tangential economic impacts that may also harm our business. If businesses are forced to raise their prices in response to tariffs or other
factors, higher prices for consumers may lead to a decrease in disposable consumer income and reduced consumer demand for many types of products, including
ours. Demand for our products could also be harmed if the indirect impacts of tariffs cause a recession and there is a decrease in consumer discretionary spending.
Given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the current and potential tariffs, as well as the potential for additional trade actions by the United
States or other countries, the ultimate impact on our business and results of operations is uncertain but could continue to be material or worsen.
