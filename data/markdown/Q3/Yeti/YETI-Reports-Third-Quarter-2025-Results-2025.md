## Third Quarter 2025 Results

Sales and adjusted sales both increased 2% to $487.8 million, compared to $478.4 million during the same period last year.

- Direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel sales increased 3% to $288.7 million, compared to $280.8 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to growth in our Amazon Marketplace business, Corporate Sales, and YETI retail stores, partially offset by a decline in sales on our US YETI website.
- Wholesale channel sales increased 1% to $199.0 million, compared to $197.6 million in the same period last year, primarily due to growth in Coolers & Equipment. Wholesale channel sales were impacted by a cautious retail environment in the US.
- Drinkware sales decreased 4% to $263.8 million, compared to $275.0 million in the prior year quarter. As expected, Drinkware growth in our international regions was more than offset by a decline in our US region, reflecting a promotional market environment and inventory constraints driven by our supply chain transition.

- The 210 basis points decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a 320 basis point unfavorable impact from higher tariff costs, as well as a lower mix of our Drinkware category. These decreases were partially offset by lower product costs, selective price increases implemented in the second quarter of 2025, and the absence in the current year quarter of purchase accounting inventory step-up amortization.

- Adjusted gross profit decreased 2% to $272.5 million, or 55.9% of adjusted sales, compared to $278.5 million, or 58.2% of adjusted sales, in the third quarter of 2024.

This increase was primarily due to growth investments related to technology and facilities, higher non-cash stock-based compensation, higher depreciation and amortization expense related to our continued capital investments to support future growth, and asset impairments, partially offset by lower marketing expenses on higher sales.

- Adjusted SG&A expenses increased 3% to $205.9 million, compared to $199.3 million in the third quarter of 2024.
- As a percentage of adjusted sales, adjusted SG&A expenses increased 50 basis points to 42.2% from 41.7% in the prior year period.

Our supply chain transformation remains firmly on track, significantly diversifying our manufacturing footprint by year-end, providing operational resilience, and enhancing our global flexibility and capabilities to support long-term innovation, growth, and profitability.

Our financial strength is a cornerstone of our strategy, providing continued fuel for investment in growth initiatives. By the end of this year, we expect to have generated nearly $1.2 billion in free cash flow since 2019. Through disciplined management, including maintaining a strong balance sheet, significant share repurchases, innovation-focused acquisitions, and the strategic reduction of our debt, we've built a stronger company and expanded our.

## Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we supplement our results with non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net sales, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share (which we also refer to as adjusted EPS), free cash flow as well as adjusted gross profit, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income and adjusted net income as a percentage of adjusted net sales.

Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures to measure our profitability and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business and are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with GAAP financial performance measures. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to such GAAP measures can be found below.

YETI does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures because such reconciliations are not available without unreasonable efforts. This is due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting with reasonable certainty certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including in particular the impacts of product recalls and realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses reported within other expense. For the same reasons, we are unable to forecast with reasonable certainty all deductions and additions needed in order to provide a forward-looking GAAP financial measures at this time. The amount of these deductions and additions may be material and, therefore, could result in forward-looking GAAP financial measures being materially different or less than forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. See Forward-looking statements below.
