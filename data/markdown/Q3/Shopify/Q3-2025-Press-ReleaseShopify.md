## Shopify Beats Across the Board: Q3 Shows Growth, Efficiency, Brand Wins

Internet, Everywhere - November 4, 2025 - Shopify Inc. (NASDAQ, TSX: SHOP) announced today financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025. Shopify achieved 32% revenue growth and 18% free cash flow margin, marking nine consecutive quarters of double-digit free cash flow margins.

Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify said, “We build. We ship. We grow. That’s the model - and it’s running at full speed. From entrepreneurs making their very first sale on Shopify every 26 seconds, to global icons like Estée Lauder, we’re powering growth across the full spectrum of commerce. That scale fuels relentless momentum: GMV up 32%, revenue up 32%, free cash flow margin at 18%. Retail’s busiest season is here, and, as always, Shopify merchants are built for it.”

“Our third quarter results show what’s possible when merchant ambition and success meet Shopify’s disciplined execution,” said Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify. “We’re not just growing—we’re delivering consistent growth and profitability, quarter after quarter. Q3 was a standout quarter with revenue growth and free cash flow margins both surpassing our robust Q2 performance.”

(3) Net income excluding the impact of equity investments is a non-GAAP financial measure which is reconciled at the end of this press release. The impact of any gains or losses on our equity investments in third parties and embedded derivative related to convertible note are not relevant to the fundamentals of our business. Valuations of third parties in public and private markets are outside of our control, and therefore, fluctuations in those valuations have little analytical or predictive value regarding our ability to drive operational results.

## Financial Performance Constant Currency Analysis

The following table converts our GMV, revenues, gross profit, and operating income using the comparative period’s monthly average exchange rates. We have provided the below disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period-to-period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. The table below and our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations disclosure are supplements to our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP (excluding GMV).

## Forward-looking Statements

This press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively, “forward-looking statements”), including statements related to Shopify’s financial outlook, such as expected revenue and expenses for the next fiscal quarter. These statements can be identified by words such as “will” and “expect” and are based on Shopify’s current projections and expectations about future events and financial results. Known and unknown risks may cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. These risks include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to maintain expected growth and manage expenses, the impact of changes in economic conditions and consumer spending in key markets such as the United States, Europe, and globally, the impact of measures that affect international trade, including tariffs, our reliance on third party cloud providers to deliver services, a cyberattack or security breach, and serious errors or defects in software or hardware. Other factors and risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements are set out in Shopify’s Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and other filings made with US and Canadian securities regulators, available at www.sec.gov and www.sedarplus.ca. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to management on the date hereof and represent management’s beliefs regarding future events, projection and financial trends, which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain. The forward-looking statements are provided to give additional information about management’s expectations and beliefs and may not be appropriate for other purposes. Shopify undertakes no duty to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law.

## Endnotes

- Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty, and value-added taxes.

- Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is the aggregate value of all subscription plans, excluding variable platform fees, in effect on the last day of the period, assuming merchants maintain their subscription the following month and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward.

- Free cash flow and free cash flow margin are non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled in the non-GAAP reconciliation at the end of this press release. Shopify believes free cash flow and free cash flow margin provide useful information to help investors and others understand our operating results and the performance of our business in the same manner as management. Shopify does not reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP free cash flow margin as certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.
