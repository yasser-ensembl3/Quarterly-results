- our products and solutions enabling and increasing the probability of merchant success;
- our beliefs regarding future macroeconomic conditions and the impact on Shopify Inc. ("Shopify" or the "Company") and our merchants, including pressure from inflation and international trade risks and trade protection measures, such as the evolving impacts from tariffs or the imposition of or an increase in tariffs, trade wars, barriers or restrictions, or threats of such actions and related uncertainty;
- the expected impact of seasonality on our current and future business;
- our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies;
- the ability to grow our addressable markets and meet merchant needs;
- our expectation that we will continue to invest in data analytics, machine learning and AI;

Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations may include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties that are discussed in greater detail in Part I — Item 1A "Risk Factors” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (the “2024 Form 10-K”), as well as in our condensed consolidated financial statements, related notes, and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Although we believe that the plans, intentions, expectations, assumptions and strategies reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond our control. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements. In addition, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future results. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.

The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent our views as at the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments may cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. Therefore, these forward-looking statements do not represent our views as of any date other than the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)

### 1. Nature of Business

Shopify Inc. ("Shopify" or the "Company") was incorporated on September 28, 2004. Shopify is a leading global commerce company that provides essential internet infrastructure for commerce, offering trusted tools to start, scale, market and run a business of any size. Shopify makes commerce better for everyone with a software platform and services that are engineered for simplicity and reliability, while delivering a better shopping experience for consumers everywhere.

### 2. Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its directly and indirectly held wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been presented in U.S. dollars ("USD") and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), including the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding financial reporting. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.

In the opinion of the Company, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of its financial position, results of operations and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the interim periods. These unaudited quarterly condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 15 in the Company's 2024 Form 10-K. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 is derived from the audited annual financial statements, but does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements.

The quarterly results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year.

### 3. Significant Accounting Policies

There have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies and no material updates in the Company's assessment of the recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

#### Recently Issued FASB Accounting Standard Codification Updates Not Yet Adopted

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 on Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures that require greater disaggregation of income tax disclosures, including the income rate tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The Company will adopt this ASU for the year ending December 31, 2025, on a retrospective basis, and is in the process of implementing reporting processes and internal workflows to support the new disclosure requirements.

In September 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-06 on Improvements to the Accounting for Internal-Use Software, which clarifies and modernizes certain aspects of the accounting for and disclosure of internal-use software costs. The ASU does not change what types of costs are capitalized or when.

## Use of Estimates

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from the estimates made by management. Significant estimates, judgments and assumptions in these condensed consolidated financial statements include: key judgments related to revenue recognition in determining whether the Company is the principal or an agent to the arrangements with merchants; estimates and judgments involved in applying the measurement alternative associated with equity and other investments in private companies, including revenue growth rates and revenue multiples based on market comparables; estimates involved in our equity method investment; and the probability and amount of loss contingencies.

## Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade and other receivables, loans, merchant cash advances and foreign exchange derivative instruments subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. Management mitigates this risk associated with cash and cash equivalents by making deposits and entering into foreign exchange derivative products only with large banks and financial institutions that are considered to be highly creditworthy. We limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct timely evaluations of the credit worthiness of these financial institutions. Management mitigates the risks associated with marketable securities by adhering to its investment policy, which stipulates minimum rating requirements, maximum investment exposures and maximum maturities. Due to the Company’s diversified merchant base, there is no particular concentration of credit risk related to the Company’s trade and other receivables, loans receivable and merchant cash advances. Trade and other receivables, loans receivable and merchant cash advances are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure timely collection of amounts. There are no receivables from individual merchants accounting for 10% or more of revenues or receivables.

## Equity and Other Investments Risk

The Company holds equity and other investments that are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings. The Company's equity and other investments in public companies are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. The Company also holds an investment option to purchase Series B common shares in Klaviyo, Inc. which is accounted for as a derivative instrument and valued using the Black-Scholes model, and is subject to market price volatility as well as a discount for lack of marketability. The Company's equity investments in private companies are recorded using the measurement alternative and are assessed each reporting period for observable price changes and impairments, which may involve estimates and judgments given the lack of readily available market data. Certain equity investments in private companies are in the early stages of development and are inherently risky due to their lack of operational history. Furthermore, for the equity method investment, Shopify's share of income and loss from these investments may cause volatility to Shopify's earnings. The Company's debt investments in convertible notes of private companies are recorded at fair value, which are impacted by the underlying entities' valuations and interest rates.

The Company has a high concentration of risk associated with a small number of equity and other investments that are impacted by fluctuations in their fair values or by observable changes or impairments.

## Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company's results of operations and foreign currency assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.

## Table of Contents

While the majority of the Company's revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses are denominated in USD, a significant portion are denominated in foreign currencies. Due to offering Shopify Payments, Shopify Capital, subscriptions and other billings to select countries in local currency, a significant proportion of revenue transactions are denominated in Euros ("EUR"), British pound sterling ("GBP") and Canadian dollars ("CAD"). Furthermore, a significant proportion of operating expenses are also incurred in the aforementioned foreign currencies.

Although foreign currency fluctuations associated with revenues and costs may partially offset one another in earnings, the Company uses foreign exchange derivative products to mitigate a portion of the remaining exposure of foreign currency fluctuations as discussed in Note 4. By their nature, derivative financial instruments involve risk, including the credit risk of non-performance by counterparties.

## 4. Financial Instruments

The Company measures financial instruments based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1), inputs from similar instruments such as quoted prices or other observable market data (Level 2) or where little or no market activity exists, using unobservable inputs that require judgment or estimation (Level 3).

### Debt Securities

The Company holds certain debt securities that are classified as held-to-maturity at the time of purchase as the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. The fair value of corporate bonds are based upon Level 2 inputs, which include period-end mid-market quotations for each underlying contract as calculated by the financial institution with which the Company has transacted. The quotations are based on bid/ask quotations and represent the discounted future settlement amounts based on current market rates.

The Company also holds debt securities in the form of convertible notes in private companies classified as available-for-sale for which the Company has elected to apply the fair value option. The investments are carried at fair value at each balance sheet date and any movements in the fair values are classified as "Other (expense) income, net" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

The following tables summarize debt securities by balance sheet classification and level within the fair value hierarchy:

(1) In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, $10 million and $33 million was transferred from Level 3 to Level 1, respectively, due to the vesting of warrants (September 30, 2024 - $8 million and $25 million). The equity investments categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy represent unvested warrants that require the application of a discount for lack of marketability which was 11% at September 30, 2025 (December 31, 2024 - 18%).

## Equity Method Investment

The Company holds an equity method investment in Flexport which is presented within "Equity method investment" in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and is carried at the amount of Shopify’s original investment, as adjusted each period for Shopify’s share of the investee’s income or loss and the basis difference amortization, which is the difference between the fair value of our investment in the company and the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee. Results are reported with a one-quarter delay due to the timing of financial information availability from the investee. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, our share of the loss in the investee was $21 million and $68 million, respectively (September 30, 2024 - $28 million and $116 million), and is presented within "net loss on equity method investment" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

## Derivative Instruments and Hedging

(1) Included in the loans receivable gross balance as of September 30, 2025 is $19 million of interest receivable (December 31, 2024 - $15 million).

Certain loans and merchant cash advances are facilitated by the Company and originated by a bank partner, from whom the Company then purchases the loans and merchant cash advances obtaining all rights, title and interest or discount. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company purchased $1.0 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, of loans and merchant cash advances to Shopify merchants (September 30, 2024 - $0.8 billion and $2.1 billion). For some loans, the Company sells its full rights, title and interest to third-party investors. We account for the asset transfer as a sale and derecognize the full amount the Company paid to its bank partner to originate the loan and record a gain on sale of the loans sold to the third-party investor as revenue upon transfer of title. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company did not sell loans to third-party investors (September 30, 2024 - $62 million and $178 million).

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recognized revenue of $66 million and $185 million, respectively, related to interest and fees earned on the Company's lending services, which do not represent revenues recognized in the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (September 30, 2024 - $56 million and $138 million).

The opening balances of current and long-term deferred revenue were $302 million and $196 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2024.

As of September 30, 2025, the long-term deferred revenue, excluding non-cash consideration received, will be recognized ratably over the remaining terms of the contracts with the customers, which range from two years to three years.

The Company has received non-cash consideration in the form of equity investments in exchange for services to be rendered as part of strategic partnerships. As the Company is required to provide referral services and other services to support the partners' merchant offerings over the period of the performance obligations, revenue is deferred and recognized over time on a ratable basis over the expected terms of the contracts.

In September 2020, the Company issued $920 million aggregate principal amount of 0.125% convertible senior notes due 2025. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were $908 million after deducting underwriting fees and offering costs.

The interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2021. The Notes will mature on November 1, 2025, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the Company or converted pursuant to their terms.

The Notes have a conversion rate of 6.9440 Class A subordinate voting shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of Notes, adjusted to give effect to the share split effected in June 2022, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $144.01. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment following the occurrence of certain specified events, as set out or defined in the supplemental indenture governing the Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change prior to the maturity date or upon our issuance of a notice of redemption, as set out or defined in the supplemental indenture governing the Notes, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional Class A subordinate voting shares for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or during the relevant redemption period. Beginning August 1, 2025, Note holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at the applicable conversion price at the time.

The Company accounts for the Notes as a single unit of account on the balance sheet. The carrying value of the liability is represented by the face amount of the Notes, less total offering costs, plus any amortization of offering costs. Total offering costs upon issuance of the Notes were $12 million and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the contractual term of the Notes. Interest expense is recognized at an annual effective interest rate of 0.38% over the contractual term of the Notes.

The net carrying amount of the outstanding Notes was as follows:

|                                      | September 30, 2025 | December 31, 2024 |

|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|

(1) As of September 30, 2025, 11,886,690 of the outstanding stock options were granted under the Company's SOP and are exercisable for Class A subordinate voting shares and 37,031 of the outstanding stock options were granted under the Deliverr 2017 Stock Option and Grant Plan and are exercisable for Class A subordinate voting shares.

(2) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying stock option awards and the closing market price of the Company's Class A subordinate voting shares as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

As of September 30, 2025, the Company had issued 4,363 deferred share units ("DSUs") under its LTIP.

In connection with the acquisition of Vantage Discovery Inc., 252,257 Class A subordinate voting shares were issued with trading restrictions. The restrictions on these shares are lifted over time and are being accounted for as stock-based compensation as the vesting is contingent on continued employment and therefore related to post-combination services. As of September 30, 2025, 252,257 of the Class A subordinate voting shares remained restricted.

The following table illustrates the classification of stock-based compensation expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, which includes both stock-based compensation and restricted stock-compensation expense:

## 15. Income Taxes

The Company's provision for income taxes is determined by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to income or loss from recurring operations and adding the effects of any discrete income tax items specific to the period.

The Company updates its estimate of the annual effective tax rate each quarter and makes cumulative adjustments if its estimated annual tax rate changes. The Company’s effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuation during the year as new information is obtained, which may affect the assumptions used to estimate the annual effective tax rate, including factors such as the mix of forecasted pre-tax earnings in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the recognition and derecognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions and changes in or the interpretation of tax laws in jurisdictions where the Company conducts business.

The Company had a provision for income taxes of $44 million and $129 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as a result of earnings in various jurisdictions, partially offset by unrealized loss on equity and other investments.

The Company had a provision for income taxes of $32 million and $81 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, on account of earnings in jurisdictions outside of North America.

## 16. Net Income per Share

The Company applies the two-class method to calculate its basic and diluted net income per share as Class A subordinate voting shares and Class B restricted voting shares are participating securities with equal participation rights and are entitled to receive dividends on a share for share basis. The Company uses the treasury stock method and if-converted method for calculating the effect of dilutive potential common stock from employee stock options and employee RSUs and from its Notes, respectively.

The following table summarizes the reconciliation of the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding:

## 17. Segment and Geographical Information

The Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is its Chief Executive Officer. The CODM has determined that the Company operates in one single operating and reportable segment and manages segment performance and resource allocation based upon consolidated net income (loss). The CODM uses consolidated net income (loss) in deciding whether to reinvest profits into opportunities for the business, invest in business combinations or equity investments or return a portion of such profits to shareholders. The measure of segment assets is reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as total consolidated assets. Significant expenses reviewed by the CODM include those that are presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

The following table presents total external revenues by geographic location, based on the location of the Company’s merchants:

## 18. Business Combinations

### Vantage Discovery Inc.

In March 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of Vantage Discovery Inc. (“Vantage”), a company based in Austin, Texas, that provides AI-powered search and content discovery services. By integrating Vantage’s hybrid search engine architecture that combines traditional search engines with vector databases and large language models, the development of AI-powered, multi-vector search across Search APIs, Shop and Storefront search offerings will be accelerated. The Company acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Vantage in exchange for cash consideration of $59 million. In connection with the transaction, $24 million in restricted shares were granted and $6 million in cash are being accounted for as compensation as these amounts are related to post-combination services.

The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation of the Vantage assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date in US $ millions:

|                                                                                                                                    | Amount |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Net assets                                                                                                            | —      |
| Intangible assets - acquired technology                                                                                                | 20     |
| Goodwill                                                                                                                               | 39     |
| Net deferred tax liability                                                                                            | —      |
| Total purchase price                                                                                                                   | 59     |

The acquired technology has an estimated fair value of $20 million using a cost approach and is being amortized over three years. Goodwill from the Vantage acquisition is attributable to the expected synergies that will result from integrating Vantage's technology with Shopify's Search offering, and the acquisition of the assembled workforce. None of the goodwill recognized is deductible for income tax purposes. There is no net deferred tax liability related to taxable temporary difference on acquired intangible assets due to offsetting deferred tax assets related to losses from the pre-acquisition period.

Item 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

In this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A"), "we", "us", "our", "Shopify" and "the Company" refer to Shopify Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. In this MD&A, we present Shopify's results of operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and our financial position as of September 30, 2025. You should read this MD&A in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto in Part 1 - Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's 2024 Form 10-K.

Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). All amounts are in U.S. dollars ("USD") except where otherwise indicated.

Our MD&A is intended to enable readers to gain an understanding of Shopify's results of operations, cash flows and financial position. To do so, we provide information and analysis comparing our results of operations, cash flows and financial position for the most recently completed period with the same period from the preceding fiscal year. We also provide analysis and commentary that we believe will help investors assess our future prospects. In addition, we provide "forward-looking statements" that are not historical facts, but that are based on our current estimates, beliefs and assumptions and which are subject to known and unknown important risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations, including those discussed under Part II — Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our 2024 Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements are intended to assist readers in understanding management's expectations as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including this MD&A, and may not be suitable for other purposes. See "Forward-looking Statements" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In this MD&A, references to our "solutions" means the combination of products and services that we offer to merchants, and references to "our merchants" as of a particular date means the total number of unique shops that are paying for a subscription to our platform.

## Business Overview

We believe we can help merchants of all verticals and sizes, from aspirational entrepreneurs to companies with large-scale, direct-to-consumer or business to business ("B2B") operations, or both, realize their potential at all stages of their business life cycle. In the nine months ended September 30, 2025, our platform facilitated gross merchandise volume ("GMV") of $254.6 billion, representing an increase of 29% from the nine months ended September 30, 2024. A detailed description of this metric is presented below in the section entitled, "Key Performance Indicators".

During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, our total revenue was $7.9 billion, an increase of 30% versus the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our business model has two revenue components: a recurring subscription component we call subscription solutions and a merchant success-based component we call merchant solutions.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2025, subscription solutions revenues accounted for 25% of our total revenues (September 30, 2024 - 28%). We offer a range of plans that increase in price depending on additional features and economic considerations. Shopify Plus is offered at a starting rate that is several times that of our standard Shopify plans. Shopify Plus solves for the complexity of merchants as they grow and scale globally, offering additional functionality and support, including features like Shopify Audiences, B2B features and Launchpad, for ecommerce automation. BarkBox, Vuori, BevMo, Carrier, JB Hi-Fi, Meta, ButcherBox, SKIMS and Supreme are a few of our notable merchants seeking a reliable, cost-effective and scalable commerce solution. The flexibility of our pricing plans is designed to help our merchants grow in a cost-effective manner and to provide more advanced features and support as their business needs evolve.

Revenue from subscription solutions is generated through the sale of subscriptions to our platform, including variable platform fees, as well as through the sale of subscriptions to our POS Pro offering, the sale of apps, the sale of themes and the registration of domain names.

## Key Performance Indicators

The following table shows MRR and GMV for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:

|                              | Three months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | | |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|---|---|
|                              | 2025          | 2024           | 2025          | 2024           |
|------------------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Monthly Recurring Revenue     | 193           | 175            | 193           | 175            |
| Gross Merchandise Volume      | 92,013        | 69,715         | 254,600       | 197,815        |

---

## Monthly Recurring Revenue

MRR is the aggregate value of all subscription plans, excluding variable platform fees, in effect on the last day of the period, assuming merchants maintain their subscription the following month. Subscription plans to both our platform and our POS Pro offering are included in this calculation. When applicable, MRR relating to subscription plans billed in a merchant's local currency is converted to USD using the respective currency exchange rate as of the period end date. Prospective merchants that have joined the platform through special new merchant trial incentives, including paid trials, are included in MRR at their trial price while merchants on free trials are excluded from the calculation of MRR through the duration of the free trial. MRR allows us to average our various pricing plans and billing periods into a single, consistent number that we can track over time. We also consider the factors that contribute to MRR, specifically the number of paying merchants using our platform, the number of merchants that are on full-price plans or paid trials, the mix of subscription plan types and overall pricing of our subscription plans. In addition, we use MRR to forecast monthly, quarterly and annual subscription plan revenue, which makes up the majority of our subscription solutions revenue. We had $193 million of MRR as of September 30, 2025 compared to $175 million as of September 30, 2024.

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the MRR growth rate for the period was lower than the same period in 2024 driven by the impact of extending the length of the paid trials.

## Gross Merchandise Volume

GMV is the total dollar value of orders facilitated through our platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes. GMV does not represent revenue earned by us. However, the volume of GMV facilitated through our platform is an indicator of the success of our merchants and the strength of our platform. Our merchant solutions revenues are also directionally correlated with the level of GMV facilitated through our platform. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 we facilitated GMV of $92.0 billion and $254.6 billion, respectively (September 30, 2024 - $69.7 billion and $197.8 billion), representing year-over-year growth of 32% on a quarterly basis and 29% on a year-to-date basis (2024 vs 2023 - 24% and 23%). On a constant currency basis, in which GMV in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 is converted using the comparative period's monthly average exchange rates, year-over-year growth was 30% and 28%, respectively (2024 vs 2023 - 24% and 23%).

## Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results

### Change in Revenue Mix

As a result of the continued growth of Shopify Payments, referral fees, other transaction services and other services rendered as part of strategic partnerships and Shopify Capital, our revenues from merchant solutions have increased. Merchant solutions are intended to complement subscription solutions by providing additional value to our merchants and increasing their use of our platform. Gross profit margins on Shopify Payments, the biggest driver of merchant solutions revenue, are typically lower than on subscription solutions due to the associated third-party costs of providing this solution. We view this revenue stream as beneficial to our operating margins, as Shopify Payments requires significantly less sales and marketing and research and development expenses than Shopify’s core subscription business. The lower margins on merchant solutions compared to subscription solutions means that the continued growth of merchant solutions has caused in the past, and may cause in the future, a decline in our overall gross margin percentage.

### Seasonality

Our merchant solutions revenues are directionally correlated with the level of GMV that our merchants facilitated through our platform. Our merchants typically process additional GMV during the fourth quarter holiday season. As a result, we have historically generated higher merchant solutions revenues in our fourth quarter than in other quarters. While we believe that this seasonality has affected and will continue to affect our quarterly results, our continued growth has partially masked seasonal trends to date. As a result of the continued growth of our merchant solutions offerings, we believe that our

- business may become more seasonal in the future and that historical patterns in our business may not be a reliable indicator of our future performance.

## Foreign Currency Fluctuations

While the majority of our revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses are denominated in USD, a significant portion are denominated in foreign currencies. Due to offering Shopify Payments, Shopify Capital, subscriptions and other billings to select countries in local currency, a significant proportion of revenue transactions are denominated in EUR, GBP and CAD. A significant proportion of operating expenses are also incurred and expected to be included in the aforementioned foreign currencies. To help mitigate the impacts associated with foreign currency fluctuations on future cash flows from operating expenses, we maintain a portfolio of foreign exchange forward contracts and options designated as hedging instruments. As our operations continue to expand internationally, we may be exposed to additional fluctuations in other foreign currencies. Refer to Part I — Item 3 "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.

## Key Components of Results of Operations

See Part II — Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2024 Form 10-K for details on the key components of results of operations. There have been no material changes to our key components of results of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to those described in our 2024 Form 10-K.

(3) In the second quarter of 2024, we released an accrual for an estimated liability of $55 million associated with a legal matter.

(5) Includes loss on the embedded derivative held to settle Notes of $29 million in the third quarter of 2025.

We believe that period-over-period comparisons are more meaningful than our sequential results due to seasonality in our business. While we believe that this seasonality has affected and will continue to affect our quarterly results, our rapid growth has partially masked seasonal trends to date. Our merchant solutions revenues are directionally correlated with our merchants' GMV. Our merchants' GMV typically increases during the fourth-quarter holiday season. As a result, we have historically generated higher merchant solutions revenues in our fourth quarter than in other quarters. As a result of the growth of our merchant solutions offerings, we believe that our business may become more seasonal in the future, and that historical patterns in our business may not be a reliable indicator of our future performance.

## Quarterly Revenue and Gross Margin Trends

Historically, revenues experienced a seasonal decrease in our first quarter as consumers typically reduce their spending following the holiday season resulting in a seasonal decrease in GMV, which was not completely offset by Shopify Payments penetration and MRR growth. Subsequently, revenues have increased in each of the next three quarters as a result of MRR and overall GMV growth. Our merchants have processed additional GMV during the fourth-quarter holiday seasons, and as a result, we have generated higher subscription solutions and merchant solutions revenues in our fourth quarters compared to other quarters. Due to the continued growth of our merchant solutions offerings, we believe that our business may become more seasonal in the future.

Our gross margin is generally driven by the mix between our higher margin subscription solutions revenue and lower margin merchant solutions revenue. While our total revenues have increased in recent periods, the mix has shifted towards merchant solutions revenue, most notably in the fourth quarter due to higher holiday volume of orders facilitated and the resulting Shopify Payments revenue during this period. We expect this overall trend to continue over time.

In connection with expanding our operations internationally, we anticipate a growing proportion of our revenues and cost of sales transactions to be incurred in foreign currencies as compared to USD due to increased Shopify Payments, Shopify Capital, subscriptions and other billings in select countries in local currency. Fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the USD may impact identified quarterly and yearly trends.

## Table of Contents

### Quarterly Operating Expenses Trends

Excluding the items outlined in the tables above, operating expenses have increased in connection with revenue and operations growth. We note a significant portion of our operating expenses are incurred in foreign currencies which may impact the comparability of our quarterly and yearly trends.

### Quarterly (Loss) Gain on Equity and Equity Method Investments and Other Income Trends

Historically, there have been no consistent trends associated with (loss) gain on equity and equity method investments and other income as changes are impacted by fluctuations in the fair value of our equity investments in public companies with readily determinable fair values, observable changes or impairments associated with our equity investments in private companies without readily determinable fair values, changes in our equity method investment based on our share of income and loss, including amortization of the basis difference, changes in the fair value of our investments in convertible notes of private companies, changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative held to settle the Notes, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The results from these changes may fluctuate from period to period and may cause volatility to our earnings as well as impact comparability of our results from period to period.

### Liquidity and Capital Resources

We generate liquidity through operating cash flows. Previously, we have financed our operations from sale of equity securities and the sale of the Notes, raising approximately $7.8 billion, net of issuance costs, from investors.

Shopify maintains a short-form base shelf prospectus with the securities commissions in each of the provinces and territories of Canada, except Quebec, and a corresponding shelf registration statement on Form F-10 with the U.S. SEC. This allows us to offer Class A subordinate voting shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants, subscription receipts, units, or any combination thereof, from time to time during the 25-month period that the shelf prospectus is effective. The type of securities and the specific terms thereof will be determined at the time of any offering and will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement to be filed separately with Canadian securities regulators and the SEC.

Our principal cash requirements are for working capital and ongoing operations. Excluding current deferred revenue and the Notes, working capital as of September 30, 2025 was $7.7 billion. As a result of our employee compensation program, there is a potential for an increase in cash usage as employees have the ability to elect how much of their total compensation will be in the form of cash versus stock-based compensation awards. Given the ongoing cash generated from operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents, we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our current and planned financial obligations over the next 12 months and into the foreseeable future. Our future financing requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to our growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of spending to support development of our platform, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the macroeconomic conditions and overall levels of consumer spending on goods and potential strategic investments and acquisitions activity. Although we currently are not a party to any material undisclosed agreement and do not have any understanding with any third parties with respect to potential material investments in, or material acquisitions of, businesses or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.

On November 3, 2025, the Company settled the outstanding Notes and the embedded derivative for $1.0 billion in cash and a nominal amount of Class A subordinate voting shares. The Company will recognize a pre-tax loss of $123 million in the year ended December 31, 2025 to reflect the value settled over the conversion price of $144.01.

## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $870 million to $6.3 billion as of September 30, 2025 from $5.5 billion as of December 31, 2024, as a result of cash provided by our operations and proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by the purchase and origination of loans, net of repayments, the purchase of equity and other investments and acquisition of business, net of cash acquired. Cash equivalents and marketable securities include money market funds, term deposits, U.S. federal bonds and agency securities and corporate bonds and commercial paper, all maturing within 12 months from September 30, 2025.

The following table summarizes our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as our operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:

## Cash Flows From Operating Activities

Our largest source of operating cash is from merchant solutions. Within merchant solutions, the largest source of cash flows are Shopify Payments processing fee arrangements, which are received on a daily basis as transactions are processed. We also generate cash flows from our subscription solutions with subscription revenues. These payments are typically paid to us at the beginning of the applicable subscription period, except for our Shopify Plus merchants who typically pay us at the end of their monthly billing cycle.

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for third-party payment processing fees, employee-related expenditures, marketing programs and outsourced hosting costs.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was the result of operating income, once adjusted for non-cash items, offset by a use of cash due to an increase in non-cash working capital.

## Cash Flows From Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was driven by $492 million used for purchases and originations of loans, net of repayments and sales, $83 million used to purchase equity and other investment, $56 million used in acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired and $16 million used to purchase property and equipment, offset by $109 million provided by maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases.

## Cash Flows From Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was driven by proceeds from the issuance of Class A subordinate voting shares and Class B restricted multiple voting shares as a result of stock options exercises.

## Table of Contents

### Contractual Obligations

Our principal commitments consist of our Notes, unconditional purchase obligations and obligations under our operating leases for office space. There have been no significant changes to our principal commitments, as compared to the principal commitments described in our 2024 Form 10-K.

### Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We retain a guarantee with respect to certain assigned leases. We have also entered into an indemnification agreement that governs the liability obligations of the purchaser in connection with these guarantees. These arrangements, and our obligations arising from such arrangements, are not expected to have a material impact on the current or future financial performance or financial condition of the Company.

### Litigation and Loss Contingencies

We are not aware of any litigation matters or loss contingencies that would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

### Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of significant judgment. Actual results may vary from our estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different, applies estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, which could materially impact our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Our critical accounting policies, estimates, and judgments are discussed in Part II — Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our 2024 Form 10-K as well as "Note 3 - Significant Accounting Policies" in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I — Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

### Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks, as discussed in Note 3 in our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2025, as well as in our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. These risks primarily include foreign currency exchange risk, equity and other investments risk, interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and inflation risk, as discussed below. We regularly assess these risks to minimize any adverse effects on our business as a result of those factors.

#### Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

While the majority of our revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses are denominated in USD, a significant portion are denominated in foreign currencies. Due to offering Shopify Payments, Shopify Capital, subscriptions and other billings to select countries in local currency, a significant proportion of revenue transactions are denominated in EUR, GBP and CAD. A significant proportion of operating expenses are also incurred in the aforementioned foreign currencies. We therefore are subject to foreign currency exchange risk related to these currencies and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To help mitigate the impacts associated with foreign currency fluctuations on future cash flows from operating expenses, we maintain a portfolio of foreign exchange derivative products designated as hedging instruments.

## Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates

The following non-GAAP financial measures convert our revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and income (loss) from operations in the current reporting period using the comparative prior year period's monthly average exchange rates:

### Three months ended September 30,
| GAAP Amounts as Reported | Exchange Rate Effect(1) | At Prior Period Effective Rates(2) | GAAP Amounts as Reported | |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|---|

| Operating expenses         | (1,048)                | —                                  | (1,048)                   | (835)                     |

(1) Represents the increase or decrease in GAAP amounts reported resulting from using the comparative period's effective foreign exchange rates. The exchange rate effect is primarily driven by fluctuations in CAD, EUR, GBP and AUD foreign exchange rates.
(2) Represents the outcome that would have resulted if the comparative period's effective foreign exchange rates are applied to the current reporting period.

This effect of foreign exchange rates on our condensed consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have provided the above non-GAAP disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(1) A 10% weakening of the foreign currencies versus the USD would have an equal and opposite impact on the Company's revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and income (loss) from operations as presented in the table.

(2) Represents the increase or decrease in GAAP amounts reported resulting from a 10% strengthening in foreign exchange rates relative to the USD.

(3) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had the foreign exchange rates relative to the USD in those periods been 10% stronger than they actually were, excluding the impact of our hedging program and without factoring in any potential changes in demand for the Company's solutions as a result of changes in exchange rates.

## Equity and Other Investments Risk

We hold equity and other investments that are subject to market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings. As of September 30, 2025, we had equity and other investments in public and private companies and our equity method investment totaled $4.9 billion. Our equity and other investments with readily determinable fair values, representing $2.8 billion of our investments as of September 30, 2025, are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. Our equity investments in private companies, representing $974 million of our investments as of September 30, 2025, are recorded using the measurement alternative and are assessed each reporting period for observable price changes and impairments, which may involve estimates and judgments given the lack of readily available market data. Certain equity investments in private companies are in the early stages of development and are inherently risky due to their lack of operational history. Our equity method investment in Flexport, representing $574 million of our investments as of September 30, 2025, is subject to market-related risks based on our share of income or loss, including amortization of the basis difference, from this investment which may cause volatility to our earnings. Our debt investments in convertible notes of private companies are recorded at fair value representing $549 million of our investments as of September 30, 2025, which are impacted by the underlying entities' valuations and interest rates. Our investment option derivative to purchase Series B common shares in Klaviyo, representing $57 million of our investments as of September 30, 2025, is impacted by market price volatility and interest rates.

Our marketable securities greater than one year, and less than 3 years, representing $676 million of our investments as of September 30, 2025, are recorded at carrying value and any changes in the fair value due to the interest rate are not recorded until the investment is sold as they are classified as "held to maturity".

The results from these changes may fluctuate from period to period and may cause volatility to our earnings as well as impact comparability of our results from period to period.

## Interest Rate Risk

We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in our cash management program totaling $6.3 billion as of September 30, 2025. The cash and cash equivalents are held for operations and working capital purposes. Our investments within cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are made for

## Table of Contents

capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into these types of investments for trading or speculative purposes.

Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates. Our future investment income may fall short of our expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as "held to maturity", no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary.

The Company holds convertible notes in private companies. These investments are classified as available-for-sale debt securities, for which we have elected to account for under the fair value option. These investments are carried at fair value at each balance sheet date and any movements in the fair value are recognized in "Net income" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The underlying entity's valuation includes inputs such as interest rates which impact the market value of the investment.

### Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade and other receivables, loans, merchant cash advances and foreign exchange derivative instruments subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. Management mitigates this risk associated with cash and cash equivalents by making deposits and entering into foreign exchange derivative products only with large banks and financial institutions that are considered to be highly creditworthy. We limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct timely evaluations of the credit worthiness of these financial institutions. Management mitigates the risks associated with marketable securities by adhering to its investment policy, which stipulates minimum rating requirements, maximum investment exposures and maximum maturities. Due to the Company’s diversified merchant base, there is no particular concentration of credit risk related to the Company’s trade and other receivables, loans receivable and merchant cash advances. Trade and other receivables, loans receivable and merchant cash advances are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure timely collection of amounts. There are no receivables from individual merchants accounting for 10% or more of revenues or receivables.

### Inflation Risk

We are subject to inflation risk that could have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our merchants are also subject to risks associated with inflationary pressures that could impact their business and financial condition. These pressures could subsequently result in impacts to our GMV and further affect our business, particularly if economic growth has slowed across many of the regions in which we operate.

### Item 4: Controls and Procedures

All control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.

### Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

Management of the Company, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by the SEC) in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act for the Company to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, that is required to be made known to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer by others within the Company and disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted by it under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2025.

### Changes in internal control over financial reporting
