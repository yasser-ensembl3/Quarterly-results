## Forward-Looking Statements

This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to statements relating to: our financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2025 and underlying assumptions; the impact of AI, ML, and LLMs; the impact of agentic search and our partnership with OpenAI; our product development investments, strategic priorities, and marketing initiatives; the impact of our investment in our app; the updates to our Insider beta program; the impact of our new ranking and recommendation models; our ability to continue share repurchases, manage our debt balance, and make ongoing investments in the business; our leadership transition; the impact of personalized browsing, discovery, and buyer experiences; the impact of the elimination of the de minimis exemption from tariffs for goods imported into the U.S.; and our approach through 2025 and beyond.

Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terms such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “enable,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend,” “may,” “optimistic,” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “should,” “target,” “will,” or similar expressions and derivative forms and/or the negatives of those words.

Forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expect. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to:
1. macroeconomic, geopolitical, and other events outside of our control;
2. the level of demand for our services or products sold in our marketplaces;
3. the importance to our success of the trustworthiness of our marketplaces and our ability to attract and retain active and engaged communities of buyers and sellers;
4. any real or perceived inaccuracies in our operational metrics;
5. if we or our third-party providers are unable to protect against technology vulnerabilities, service interruptions, security breaches, or other cyber incidents;
6. our dependence on continued and unimpeded access to third-party services, platforms, and infrastructure;
7. operational and compliance risks related to our payments systems;
8. the global scope of our business;
9. our ability to recruit and retain employees;
10. our ability to compete effectively;
11. our ability to enhance our current offerings and develop new offerings to respond to the changing needs of sellers and buyers;
12. risks related to our environmental, social, and governance activities and disclosures;
13. barriers to international trade and our efforts to grow our markets globally;
14. acquisitions, dispositions, or strategic partnerships that may prove unsuccessful or divert management attention;
15. our ability to deal effectively with fraud or other illegal activity;
16. the impact of artificial intelligence on our business and industry; and
17. litigation and evolving global legal and regulatory requirements, including privacy and data protection laws, tax laws, product liability laws, laws regulating speech and platform moderation, antitrust laws, and intellectual property and counterfeiting regulations.

These and other risks and uncertainties are more fully described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and subsequent reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, achievements, or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur. Forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date hereof. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.

This presentation is a high-level summary of our Q3 2025 financial results. For more information please refer to our press release dated October 29, 2025 and filings with the SEC. Please see the appendix for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this presentation to their respective most directly comparable financial measures, where available, calculated in accordance with GAAP.

For information about how we define active buyers, new buyers, reactivated buyers, repeat buyers and habitual buyers, see our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

### HOW IT WORKS:

- ChatGPT already surfaced Etsy listings organically; native checkout is enabled for items in the product feed we provide, and processed via Etsy Payments.
- We pay a performance-based fee to OpenAI — similar to affiliate or influencer channels — only on Instant Checkout transactions.

### Initial rollout:
- U.S. buyers
- No added seller fees for included listings

- Buyers check out as guests, with option to link or create accounts — enabling personalization and retention.

| Adjusted EBITDA Margin      | ~24%                   |

Please note that our guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain unchanged at current levels.

With respect to our expectations above, reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from Adjusted EBITDA; in particular, stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes, foreign exchange (gain) loss, acquisition, divestiture, and other corporate structure-related expenses; and other non-recurring expenses can have unpredictable fluctuations based on unforeseen activity that is out of our control and/or cannot reasonably be predicted.

(1) Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, the Company is excluding payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA because these taxes are directly related to stock-based compensation expense which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. The Company did not retrospectively apply this change to prior periods as the impact was immaterial to such periods.

## Reconciliation of Operating Cash Flow to Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. We believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
