BROOKLYN, N.Y., Oct. 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Etsy, Inc. (NYSE: ETSY), which operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world, today announced results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

"Etsy's third quarter consolidated results surpassed expectations across all three of our key financial metrics — and GMS for Etsy and Depop combined returned to year-over-year growth," said Josh Silverman, Etsy, Inc. Chief Executive Officer. "Etsy marketplace GMS improved sequentially, reflecting growing traction in our customer-centric priorities — from showing up where shoppers discover, to enhancing AI-powered matching, retaining and rewarding our most valuable customers, and further amplifying the human connection that makes Etsy so unique. Depop also continued to accelerate GMS growth, building its position as a leading player in the U.S. resale clothing business."

## Third Quarter 2025 Highlights

Consolidated results: Etsy completed the sale of Reverb on June 2, 2025. Note that on an 'as reported' basis, all year-over-year consolidated performance comparisons were impacted by this transaction.

---

## Performance highlights for the Etsy marketplace include:

- GMS was $2,724.7 million, up 0.9% year-over-year and 0.1% on a currency-neutral basis, excluding Reverb from the prior-year period.
- On an as reported basis, including Reverb's third quarter 2024 GMS of $213.7 million, consolidated GMS was down 6.5% year-over-year.
- Revenue was $678.0 million, up 6.1% year-over-year, excluding Reverb from the prior-year period.
- On an as reported basis, including Reverb's third quarter 2024 revenue of $23.2 million, consolidated revenue was up 2.4% year-over-year.
- Take rate was 24.9%. Growth in revenue was primarily driven by continued strong Etsy and Depop on-site ads performance.
- Net income was $75.5 million, up $18.1 million year-over-year, reflecting a non-cash foreign exchange gain of $0.8 million as compared to a non-cash foreign exchange loss of $16.8 million in the third quarter of 2024.
- Consolidated net income margin was 11.1% and diluted net income per share was $0.63.
- Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA was $171.9 million, with consolidated non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 25.4%.
- Etsy ended the third quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments.
- Under Etsy's stock repurchase program, during the third quarter of 2025 Etsy repurchased an aggregate of approximately $120 million, or 2.1 million shares, of its common stock.

## Financial Performance

- GMS was $2,432.6 million, down 2.4% year-over-year and down 3.2% on a currency-neutral basis.
- GMS transacted on the Etsy App grew 5% year-over-year, and represented approximately 46% of GMS.

## Partnership

- Etsy signed a partnership agreement with OpenAI which enables U.S. ChatGPT users to discover and purchase millions of unique items from our U.S. sellers directly within the ChatGPT interface, tapping into high intent traffic from an emerging platform.

## Key Product and Marketing Initiatives

- Improving Search ranking models to deliver more relevant results, driving a lift in conversion rates.
- Launching new seller tools to save time and support business growth — such as task prioritization, marketplace insights, and AI-powered features such as title suggestions and Writing Assistant.
- Enhancing the Etsy App to make shopping more personalized and engaging, with a refreshed home hub, improved discovery feeds, and a reorganized Shop Tab featuring recommendations tailored for each user.
- Optimizations of data feeds and advanced segmentation strategies contributed to strong GMS from paid search channels.
- Deeper machine learning based personalization which drove accelerating performance in Etsy owned marketing channels.

## Active Sellers and Buyers

- Active sellers totaled 5.5 million, a 10.9% year-over-year decrease, but up modestly on a sequential basis, consistent with the expected impact of the seller set-up fee implemented in April 2024. The percentage of total active sellers with a sale increased year-over-year in the third quarter.
- Active buyers totaled 86.6 million, down 5.0% year-over-year, and down 0.8% sequentially. We reactivated 6.6 million buyers in the quarter, a 3.8% increase from the number of buyers reactivated in the prior year, and up 0.8% sequentially. During the quarter, Etsy acquired 4.8 million new buyers, and our trailing twelve month count of habitual buyers was 6.0 million at quarter end.
- GMS per active buyer on a trailing twelve month basis was $121, down 1.6% year-over-year. This metric improved sequentially, and the year-over-year decline moderated.

## Consolidated Fourth Quarter 2025 Financial Guidance

|                          | Q4 25 Guidance      |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| GMS                      | $3.5B-$3.65B        |
| Take Rate                | ~24.5%              |
| Adjusted EBITDA Margin    | ~24%                |

Regarding Etsy's outlook, Baker commented, "We are pleased that at the midpoint, our fourth quarter consolidated GMS would represent further sequential improvement in our combined Etsy marketplace and Depop year-over-year growth rate. Our expectation for fourth quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin reflects stable, strong profitability for the Etsy marketplace, paired with a significant sequential increase in brand marketing investment at Depop which will compress margin performance. This investment in Depop is discretionary and opportunistic, arising from our excitement about the scale and growth of the apparel resale market, as well as Depop's own very encouraging momentum."

Please note that our guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain unchanged at current levels.

## Adjusted EBITDA Exclusion

Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, the Company is excluding payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA because these taxes are directly related to stock-based compensation expense which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. The Company did not retrospectively apply this change to prior periods as the impact was immaterial to such periods. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation was $0.7 million and $4.8 million, respectively.

## Retroactive Non-Income Tax Expense

Retroactive non-income tax expense related to the digital services tax legislation in Canada, which was enacted on June 28, 2024 retroactive to January 1, 2022.
