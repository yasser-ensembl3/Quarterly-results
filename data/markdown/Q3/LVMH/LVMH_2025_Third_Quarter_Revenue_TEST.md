Improvement in trends in the third quarter of 2025
Paris, October 14, 2025
LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s leading high-quality products group, recorded
revenue of €58.1 billion in the first nine months of 2025. LVMH showed good resilience and maintained
its powerful innovative momentum despite a disrupted geopolitical and economic environment. Europe
and the United States, which remained stable with respect to the first nine months of 2024, benefited
from solid local demand. Japan was down with respect to the same period in 2024, which had been
boosted by growth in tourist spending due to the much weaker yen. The rest of Asia saw a noticeable
improvement in trends with respect to 2024.
With 1% organic growth, the third quarter saw an improvement across all business groups and all
regions, with the exception of Europe, where revenue from tourist spending declined, affected by
currency fluctuations, which weighed more on the quarter than earlier in the year.
Revenue by business group changed as follows:

* On a constant consolidation scope and currency basis. For the Group, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations in the first
nine months of 2025 was -2% and the impact of changes in scope was negligible. For the third quarter of 2025, the exchange
rate impact was -5% and the impact of changes in scope was negligible.
The Wines & Spirits business group posted slight organic growth in the third quarter, despite a decline
in its revenue in the first nine months of 2025, with a sequential improvement in champagne and wines,
and a good performance in Provence rosé wines. The trends seen in cognac since the beginning of the
year were similar to those observed in 2024, due in particular to the impact of trade tensions weighing
on demand in the key markets of the United States and China.
The Fashion & Leather Goods business group saw revenue decline in the first nine months of 2025,
with an improvement in the third quarter, reflecting good resilience with local customers, whereas 2024
had been boosted by strong growth in tourist spending, particularly in Japan. Louis Vuitton continued
to demonstrate exceptionally powerful creativity through its iconic products and unique in-store

experiences. This was reflected in the latest fashion shows by Nicolas Ghesquière and Pharrell Williams,
as well as the exceptional architecture of “The Louis”, a museum-like space in the form of a cruise ship
in Shanghai, reimagining the Maison’s spirit of travel and drawing a very high number of visitors.
Another highlight of the quarter was the launch of La Beauté Louis Vuitton, a new creative universe led
by Dame Pat McGrath, with an exacting focus on the composition, innovation and sustainability of
Louis Vuitton makeup, which was a major success. At Christian Dior, the Maison’s new Creative
Director Jonathan Anderson introduced a contemporary “new look”. His first Women’s and Men’s
collections were tremendously well received. Embodying French elegance, two “House of Dior”
locations were inaugurated in New York and Beverly Hills. For the Maison’s latest jewelry designs,
Victoire de Castellane revisited the ancient art of origami, drawing inspiration from haute couture. Loro
Piana continued its pursuit of excellence, partnering once again with Team Europe, the winner of the
2025 Ryder Cup, the world’s most prestigious team golf tournament. The Maison also confirmed its
status as “Master of Fibers” at the presentation of its latest collection at the Palazzo Citterio in Milan.
The first fashion shows by new creative directors Michael Rider at Celine, Jack McCollough and Lazaro
Hernandez at Loewe, and Sarah Burton at Givenchy received an excellent response. At Fendi, Silvia
Venturini Fendi was appointed Honorary President and Maria Grazia Chiuri was appointed Chief
Creative Officer of the Roman Maison.
The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group, for which revenue remained stable on an organic basis in
the first nine months of 2025, maintained its robust innovation policy and highly selective retail
approach. In fragrances, Parfums Christian Dior benefited from the successful launches of Miss Dior
Essence and Dior Homme Parfum. Sauvage remained the world’s best-selling fragrance. In makeup, the
new Rouge Dior On Stage lipstick as well as innovations within Forever and Dior Addict also
contributed to the Maison’s performance. Guerlain was buoyed by the latest additions to its Aqua
Allegoria and L’Art & La Matière fragrance lines. Parfums Givenchy unveiled a new floral version of
its iconic scent with L’Interdit Parfum.
The Watches & Jewelry business group saw organic growth in the first nine months of 2025. Tiffany
& Co. continued the successful enhancement of its iconic lines and the global rollout of its store concept
inspired by The Landmark in New York. Recently opened locations in Milan and Tokyo enjoyed a high
level of in-store traffic and revenue. Paying tribute to the Maison’s most famous brooch, designed by
Jean Schlumberger, the new Bird on a Rock had a particularly promising debut. Bvlgari was buoyed by
the ongoing development of Serpenti and the excellent results achieved by its Polychroma high jewelry
collection. The Kaleidos exhibition in Tokyo and the Serpenti Infinito exhibition in Mumbai showcased
the Maison’s expert craftsmanship. Chaumet continued to develop its emblematic Bee de Chaumet
jewelry line. In watches, TAG Heuer enjoyed a high-profile presence at the Grand Prix races of
Formula 1 as part of the 10-year partnership entered into in 2024. A number of innovations from
LVMH’s watchmaking Maisons were unveiled at Geneva Watch Days, including TAG Heuer’s
revolutionary Carbonspring oscillator.
In Selective Retailing, revenue grew in the first nine months of 2025. Sephora achieved a remarkable
performance, once again delivering sustained growth in revenue. The Maison saw further market share
gains in many countries, consolidating its global leadership position. Sephora continued to enrich its
unique selection of brands, with Rhode in particular achieving a record-breaking launch. DFS saw revenue
trends improve in the third quarter, in particular in Macao and Hong Kong, while the operational
streamlining measures taken since the beginning of the year are bearing fruit. Le Bon Marché posted
growth, driven by the department store’s differentiation strategy focused on its continuously renewed
selection of products and unique array of cultural events.
