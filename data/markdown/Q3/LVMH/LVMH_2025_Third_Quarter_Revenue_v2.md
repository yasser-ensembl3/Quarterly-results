# LVMH 2025 Third Quarter Revenue

## Improvement in trends in the third quarter of 2025

Paris, October 14, 2025

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s leading high-quality products group, recorded revenue of €58.1 billion in the first nine months of 2025. LVMH showed good resilience and maintained its powerful innovative momentum despite a disrupted geopolitical and economic environment. Europe and the United States, which remained stable with respect to the first nine months of 2024, benefited from solid local demand. Japan was down with respect to the same period in 2024, which had been boosted by growth in tourist spending due to the much weaker yen. The rest of Asia saw a noticeable improvement in trends with respect to 2024.

With 1% organic growth, the third quarter saw an improvement across all business groups and all regions, with the exception of Europe, where revenue from tourist spending declined, affected by currency fluctuations, which weighed more on the quarter than earlier in the year.

### Revenue by business group changed as follows:

| In millions of euros    | First 9 months 2024 | First 9 months 2025 | Change: First 9 months 2025/2024 | Change: Q3 2025/2024 |
|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Wines & Spirits         | 4,193               | 3,917               | -7%                              | +1%                  |
| Fashion & Leather Goods | 29,922              | 27,611              | -8%                              | -2%                  |
| Perfumes & Cosmetics    | 6,148               | 6,040               | -2%                              | +2%                  |
| Watches & Jewelry       | 7,536               | 7,409               | -2%                              | +2%                  |
| Selective Retailing     | 12,559              | 12,613              | 0%                               | +7%                  |
| Other activities and eliminations | 395       | 500                 | -                                | -                    |
| **Total LVMH**         | **60,753**          | **58,090**          | **-4%**                          | **+1%**              |

* On a constant consolidation scope and currency basis. For the Group, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations in the first nine months of 2025 was -2% and the impact of changes in scope was negligible. For the third quarter of 2025, the exchange rate impact was -5% and the impact of changes in scope was negligible.

The Wines & Spirits business group posted slight organic growth in the third quarter, despite a decline in its revenue in the first nine months of 2025, with a sequential improvement in champagne and wines, and a good performance in Provence rosé wines. The trends seen in cognac since the beginning of the year were similar to those observed in 2024, due in particular to the impact of trade tensions weighing on demand in the key markets of the United States and China.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group saw revenue decline in the first nine months of 2025, with an improvement in the third quarter, reflecting good resilience with local customers, whereas 2024 had been boosted by strong growth in tourist spending, particularly in Japan. Louis Vuitton continued to demonstrate exceptionally powerful creativity through its iconic products and unique in-store.
