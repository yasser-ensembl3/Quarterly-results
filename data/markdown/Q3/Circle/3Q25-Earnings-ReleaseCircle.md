Third Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights and Operating Results
● Reserve Income of $711 million increased 60% year-over-year, primarily from the 97% growth in
average USDC in circulation, partially offset by a 96 bps decline in the reserve return rate.
● Other Revenue of $29 million up $28 million year-over-year as subscription and services
revenue and transaction revenue grew strongly.
● Total Distribution, Transaction and Other Costs of $448 million increased 74% year-over-year,
primarily from increased distribution payments reflecting higher USDC circulation balances and
growth in Coinbase’s average on-platform holdings of USDC, and other strategic partnerships.
● Operating Expenses of $211 million increased 70% year-over-year, primarily from higher
compensation expenses, including $59 million of stock-based compensation expense in Q3.
● Adjusted Operating Expenses of $131 million increased 35% year-over-year, primarily driven by
higher cash compensation expenses due to increased average headcount of 14%, and general
and administrative expenses.
● Net Income of $214 million increased 202% year-over-year and included an income tax benefit
of $61 million due to stock-based compensation expense, research and development tax
credits and the impact of recently enacted U.S. tax legislation. Net Income also included a $48
million benefit from the decrease in fair value of our convertible debt caused by a lower stock
price in the third quarter.
● Adjusted EBITDA of $166 million increased 78% year-over-year reflecting the revenue growth
from higher USDC in circulation and the operating leverage inherent in our business model.
Other Notable Items and Recent Developments
● Arc public testnet: Circle announced the launch of Arc public testnet on Oct 28, with more than
100 participating companies. Arc is the Circle Layer-1 blockchain designed to meet the needs of
developers and companies seeking to bring more economic activity onchain with
programmable financial infrastructure for the global economy. Notably, the launch includes
leading institutions spanning capital markets, banks, asset managers, insurers, payments,
fintech and technology, as well as all parts of the digital asset ecosystem.
● Native token on Arc: Circle is exploring the possibility of launching a native token on the Arc
network which could foster network participation to drive adoption, further align the interests of
Arc stakeholders and support the long-term growth and success of the Arc network.
● CPN: CPN now supports flows in 8 countries with 29 financial institutions enrolled on CPN, 55
additional going through eligibility reviews and 500 in the pipeline. Since launch in late May this
year, activity has grown sharply with annualized transaction volume based on trailing 30 day
activity of $3.4 billion as of November 7, 2025.

Forward-Looking Statements
This communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact are
forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our
future operating results and financial position, including for the third quarter ended September 30,
2025; our plans with respect to the anticipated future expenses and investments; expectations relating
to certain of our key financial and operating metrics; our business strategy and plans; expectations
relating to legal and regulatory proceedings; expectations relating to our industry, the regulatory
environment, market conditions, trends and growth; expectations relating to customer behaviors and
preferences; our market position; potential market opportunities; and our objectives for future
operations. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “potential,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,”
“expect,” “could,” “would,” “project,” “plan,” “target,” and similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s expectations,
assumptions, and projections based on information available at the time the statements were made.
These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions,
including, but not limited to: intense and increasing competition from new and existing issuers offering
competing products, combined with the rise of yield-bearing digital assets, including TMMFs, that are
attractive to digital asset trading participants, may reduce market demand and circulation of Circle
stablecoins; stablecoins may face periods of uncertainty, loss of trust, or systemic shocks resulting in
the potential for rapid redemption requests (or runs), and extreme scenarios, such as market shocks
that affect the value of USDC’s reserves or simultaneous requests to redeem all or substantially all
USDC in circulation, or concerns related to Circle stablecoin reserves, may lead to redemption delays
and USDC reserves being insufficient to meet all redemption requests; as a relatively new innovation,
stablecoins are particularly susceptible to operational challenges and risks, including due to surges in
demand; any negative publicity regarding stablecoins or the broader digital asset industry may have an
outsized negative effect on consumer confidence; the acceptance of Circle stablecoins could be
negatively impacted by the disruptions in secondary marketplaces that facilitate the purchase and sale
of Circle stablecoins; the GENIUS Act will change the payment stablecoin ecosystem and may affect
our business in ways that cannot yet be known; the GENIUS Act amends the U.S. federal securities
laws to explicitly exclude from the definition of “security” payment stablecoins issued by PPSIs, which
will include USDC, however, until those amendments are effective, we will continue to rely on our
conclusion that USDC is not a security under the U.S. federal securities laws; we hold a substantial
amount of USDC reserves in the Circle Reserve Fund and thus are subject to risks associated with the
issuer, the manager, and the custodian of the Circle Reserve Fund; any significant disruption in our or
our third-party service providers’ or partners’ technology could result in a loss of customers or funds
and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects; our
customers’ funds and digital assets may fail to be adequately safeguarded by us or the third-party
service providers upon whom we rely; our inability to maintain existing relationships with financial
5



## Page 6

institutions and similar firms or to enter into new such relationships could impact our ability to offer
services to customers; we are subject to credit risks in respect of counterparties, including banks and
other financial institutions; if we are unable to maintain existing distribution arrangements or enter into
additional distribution arrangements on less favorable financial terms, USDC and EURC in circulation
and Circle’s financial results may be adversely affected; the Arc network may not be successful and we
may not realize a return on our investments and resources devoted to this project; any potential launch
of a native token on the Arc network is uncertain and may pose additional risks to Circle; our products
and services may be exploited by our customers, employees, service providers, and other third parties
to facilitate illegal activity such as fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, gambling, tax evasion,
and scams; our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective; fluctuations in
interest rates could impact our results of operations; we are subject to an extensive and highly evolving
regulatory landscape; the regulatory environment to which we are subject gives rise to various
licensing requirements, significant compliance costs and other restrictions, and noncompliance could
result in a range of penalties, including fines, compliance costs, operational restrictions, reputational
damage, and loss of licenses; we are subject to laws, regulations, and executive orders regarding
economic and trade sanctions, anti-bribery, AML, and counter-terrorism financing that could impair our
ability to compete in international markets or subject us to criminal or civil liability if we violate them;
and insiders will continue to have substantial control over Circle and limit shareholders ability to
influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control. It is not possible for our
management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the
extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties,
and assumptions, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or
implied in the forward-looking statements. Further information on risks that could cause actual results
to differ materially from forecasted results are, or will be included, in our filings we make with the SEC
from time to time, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2025 to be filed with the SEC on November 12, 2025. Except as required by law, we assume no
obligation to update these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons if actual results differ
materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.

Quarterly Results of Operations
The following table summarizes certain key financial performance measures derived from our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of
operations data for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024, December 31, 2024, March 31, 2025, June 30, 2025, and
September 30, 2025. The information for each of these periods has been prepared on the same basis as our audited annual consolidated
financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are necessary for the fair
statement of the results of operations for these periods.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). However, Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted Operating Expenses are non-GAAP financial measures regarding our operational performance.
Management and our board of directors use non-GAAP financial measures to (i) monitor and evaluate the growth and performance of our
business operations, (ii) evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors,
(iii) review and assess the performance of our management team and other employees, and (iv) prepare budgets and evaluate strategic
investments. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and
evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Non-GAAP financial measures, including
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Expenses, have limitations as financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for,
or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income (loss) from continuing operations excluding: depreciation and amortization expense; interest
expense, net of amortization of discounts and premiums; interest income; income tax expense (benefit); stock-based compensation expense;
certain legal expenses; realized and unrealized (gains) losses, net, on digital assets held for investment, other related investments and
strategic investments; realized (gains) losses on available-for-sale debt securities; impairment losses on strategic investments; merger
termination expenses; restructuring expenses; acquisition-related costs; change in fair value of convertible debt, warrant liability, and
embedded derivatives; losses on sale of long-lived assets; and foreign currency exchange (gain) loss.
We believe it is useful to exclude non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and change
in fair value of various financial instruments from Adjusted EBITDA because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not
directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. We believe it is useful to exclude income tax expense (benefit),
interest income, interest expense, and non-routine items as these items are not components of our core business operations.
Adjusted Operating Expenses
Adjusted operating expenses excludes depreciation and amortization, future Donor Advised Fund (DAF) contributions to the Circle
Foundation, digital asset (gains) losses, and stock-based compensation.
We believe it is useful to exclude certain non-cash charges from Adjusted Operating Expenses because the amount of such expenses in any
specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations.
We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations and of Adjusted Operating
Expenses to Operating Expenses, in each case, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
