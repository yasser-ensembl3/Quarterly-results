Presentation

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. My name is Krista, and I will be your conference
operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Circle Group -- Circle Internet Group Third
Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference over to John Andrews, Vice President of Capital Markets and
Investor Relations. John, you may begin.
John Andrews
Vice President of Capital Markets & Investor Relations
Thank you, operator, and good morning. I'd like to welcome you to Circle's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings
Call. I'm joined by Jeremy Allaire, our Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Jeremy Fox-
Geen, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we posted our earnings press release and earnings
presentation on the Circle Investor Relations website, investor.circle.com. A transcript of this call will be
posted on that website once available.
I do need to remind everyone that our earnings press release, presentation and this call contain
statements that are forward looking. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks
and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond our
control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The
events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
Information concerning risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause these results to differ
is included in our SEC filings. We will also disclose non-GAAP financial measures on this call today.
Definitions of those non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP
financial measures can be found in the earnings press release and earnings presentation, which are
posted on Circle's Investor Relations website, investor.circle.com. Non-GAAP financial measures should be
considered in addition to, not as a substitute for GAAP measures.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeremy Allaire.
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Thank you, John. I'm excited to talk with all of you today about our quarterly results and general outlook.
But before I do, I want to talk about our broader vision for what is taking place in this market, a vision
of an internet financial system that guides what we're building towards at Circle. Our vision from the
beginning has been that a new set of open Internet infrastructure and open software infrastructure would
collide with the global financial system and ultimately transform it. We are moving more and more towards
that world and realizing that vision.
What we are seeing emerge is the opportunity to build a full-stack Internet financial platform company
with several platform layers. The first layer, blockchain networks are becoming foundational operating
systems for economic activity on the Internet, what we call economic OSs for the Internet. These
infrastructure layers will be part of migrating coordination, governance, value storage, financial contracts
and other forms of economic intermediation into a software-powered and agentic economic system. This is
an enormous platform and infrastructure opportunity that we believe is even larger than any past Internet
platform technology.
On top of these economic OSs is the second platform layer of digital assets. This includes stablecoins,
Internet native digital assets based on protocols and applications and broader tokenization, including the
tokenization of traditional assets and many other types of economic contracts. All of these digital assets
will be built on the first layer of blockchain networks, the economic OSs for the Internet. This digital asset

CIRCLE INTERNET GROUP, INC. FQ3 2025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 12, 2025
layer is fundamental to how economic value will be stored, transformed, transmitted and exchanged all
around the world.
On top of the blockchain and digital asset layers is the third layer, new application utilities that are built
for the Internet economy, application utilities for payments, commerce, treasury management, capital
formation, lending, governance and many other applications that are fundamental to economic activity.
Full-stack Internet financial platforms are emerging, and Circle intends to be the leader in this space.
With that backdrop, I want to discuss our latest results and our progress in expanding our platform and
building towards the vision that I just described. In Q3, we saw very strong growth in our network. USDC
in circulation grew 108% year-over-year to $73.7 billion. This is tremendous growth. And we're very proud
that our growth also represents continued market share expansion. Moreover, the amount of onchain
transactions using USDC grew 580% year-over-year to $9.6 trillion in Q3, underscoring the inherent and
increasing velocity and efficiency of using USDC as a medium of exchange. This increasing velocity of
money is a crucial feature of the Internet financial system. We had strong financial results in the third
quarter.
We realized $740 million in total revenue and reserve income, representing 66% year-on-year growth.
Our adjusted EBITDA grew 78% year-on-year to $166 million, with a 57% adjusted EBITDA margin, a 737
basis point expansion. And we've delivered continued expansion in our platform. We launched Arc into
public testnet in recent weeks with over 100 major participants. I'm going to talk more about that in a few
minutes.
We're also sharing today that we are exploring the possibility of launching a native token on the Arc
Network, which we think could be an important component for driving utility, incentives, growth and
governance of the Arc Network. We saw Circle Payments Network product expansion with multiple product
releases and significant growth in transaction volumes, and we've continued to expand our stablecoin
network across more chains with 5 new chain launches and 28 supported chains today, part of our deep
commitment to maintaining a strongly market-neutral position.
And adoption has been expanding across a range of use cases, industries and types of firms. Overall, the
stablecoin market has continued to grow strongly, and Circle continues to gain share. On a year-over-year
basis, stablecoins in circulation grew 59%. Because we grew faster than the overall market, Circle's share
grew to 29% in the third quarter. Based on Visa's published analysis, stablecoin transaction volumes have
grown approximately 130% year-over-year with USDC share expanding to 40% in Q3. And as you can
see, the dollar stablecoin space remains a market with 2 leading issuers and a number of much smaller
players as we continue to sustain our strong position despite increasing competition.
At the heart of our competitive position are durable and powerful network effects that are anchored in
several areas: the trust that we have enshrined in our infrastructure by being regulated, audited, public,
transparent and compliant; the core liquidity infrastructure, our reserve infrastructure with systemically
important banks and banking connectivity around the world providing at-scale minting and redemption.
But also our broad distribution across blockchain networks and ecosystems, which has helped sustain the
broader utility of our network.
And we continue to innovate in product and technology and developer services which provides powerful
infrastructure for application developers, financial infrastructure companies and others to build on.
Crucially, we have been able to maintain our competitive position by being a market-neutral infrastructure
that leading companies can build on top of. Our stablecoin network growth remains strong. As already
noted, onchain transaction volume grew to $9.6 trillion in the quarter, up from $5.9 trillion in Q2.
CCTP, our Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol is a key infrastructure in enabling capital efficient and secure
transfers of digital dollars across blockchain networks, applications and services. CCTP volume grew
approximately 640% year-over-year to $31.3 billion in Q3. And in fact, over the quarter of all bridged
volume of all assets from major bridge providers that we track, CCTP represented 47% of all of that
traffic. In October, it was over 50%.

CIRCLE INTERNET GROUP, INC. FQ3 2025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 12, 2025
This is really key as we think about the expanding role that Circle can play in providing infrastructure
that supports broader cross-chain interoperability for digital assets. We're continuing to gain share in
digital asset trading markets as well. It's a key priority for us. And you see this in our growing share
of spot trading year-over-year and then the ongoing expansion of USDC within perpetual markets, in
particular, on platforms such as Binance, the world's largest centralized exchange and Hyperliquid, the
largest decentralized exchange.
From June 30 to November 8, we've seen our tokenized money market fund, USYC, more than triple in
size to approximately $1 billion, making it the second largest TMMF in the world. This is an important
part of our growth in tokenized collateral for digital asset markets. And use case expansion and adoption
is growing. We're seeing adoption in capital markets, in payments, in the digital assets ecosystem with
banking infrastructure providers and to provide dollar access around the world, including with leading
companies such as Brex, Deutsche Börse, Fireblocks, Finastra, Kraken and Itaú, the largest bank in Latin
America. These are all key use cases with industry-leading companies that chose to work with Circle and
which will be important to the ongoing growth and adoption of our stablecoin network.
While USDC and Circle's broader stablecoin network are central to our business today, we are continuing
to expand our platform across key dimensions. Coming back to this idea of building a full-stack Internet
platform company, Circle has been methodically building infrastructure that goes down the stack into
the core network operating system layer with Arc and moving up the stack into the application utility
layer with CPN. With Arc, we've just delivered a critical and significant milestone in recent weeks with the
launch of the Arc public testnet.
When we think about this layer of infrastructure, we really look at it as an operating system layer, an
economic OS for the Internet. Over prior decades, there have been fundamental platform shifts for how
software infrastructure supported growth in the utility of the Internet, the web as an OS for information
and data, the evolution into mobile as an organizing operating environment, cloud as an operating
infrastructure and then other core utilities such as social, search and commerce, helping to organize
ecosystems, platforms and activity. And now we're seeing 2 new major operating system paradigms, AI
platforms and blockchain platforms.
With Arc, we've created something that is enterprise-grade and purpose built to bring stablecoin finance
and real-world economic activity on chain. Our public testnet launched with over 100 world-class
companies spanning every major category of the financial industry, major payments firms, technology
companies, fintechs and broad support across the digital asset markets industry. From Apollo to AWS,
BlackRock, HSBC, Mastercard, Standard Chartered, Visa and so many other tremendous firms who are
testing, evaluating and collaborating with Circle as we seek to bring Arc to commercial mainnet launch
in 2026. We've also been activating Arc across our entire Circle product suite, making it seamless for
developers and all participants in the ecosystem to take advantage of this new infrastructure from Circle
as they prepare for Arc mainnet.
Our vision for Arc is of a globally distributed network with infrastructure operators all around the world, in
every region of the world, from every economic system in the world. And we envision strong stakeholder
incentives and governance to help drive the adoption and evolution of this network. Consistent with that
thinking, Circle is actively exploring the introduction of a native token on the Arc Network. This is an
exciting development that we're actively looking at, and we'll share more as we continue our exploration.
We are also seeing strong early momentum for Circle Payments Network, and we have expanded the CPN
product portfolio. We launched CPN Console which brings self-service operations to CPN members for
onboarding, integration and operating payment flows on behalf of their customers. This will streamline our
ability to bring more members and more institutions onto the network.
CPN Marketplace itself has continued to expand as I'll talk about momentarily. And we launched a new
capability called CPN Payouts, which is purpose-built for automated stablecoin payouts on CPN. We've
seen a number of financial institutions enrolled on the network grow to 29. We've also seen more and
more institutions that are actively engaged in eligibility reviews to integrate to our network, including 55
financial institutions. And the overall pipeline of financial institutions seeking to join CPN has grown to 500.

Across these participants are global systemically important banks, payment service providers, cross-
border firms, neobanks, digital asset firms and many others. We've continued to expand the markets
where CPN is available with live flows happening across Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Mexico,
Nigeria and the United States. And we expect upcoming launches for flows into Colombia, the European
Union, the Philippines, Singapore, the UAE and the United Kingdom to name a few.
We've also been seeing strong early adoption with rapid growth in CPN's monthly total payment volume
from our first full month only 5 months ago to November 7, we've seen over 100x growth in trailing 30-
day payment volumes. As of last Friday, annualized transaction volume based on trailing 30 days is $3.4
billion. We're excited about this expansion of Circle's platform, continuing to build out what we believe can
be one of the most significant and broadly adopted Internet financial platforms in the world.
With that, I'm pleased to turn this over to Jeremy Fox-Geen for the financial review.
Jeremy Fox-Geen
Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. 2025 continues to be a year defined by growth, and I'm
pleased to report we continued this momentum in the third quarter, delivering strong financial results. I'll
start by briefly recapping the fundamentals of our business and financial model. Stablecoins are a network
business and successful networks are enduring and valuable. Our strategy remains to grow and deepen
our network. We earn reserve income on the assets backing our stablecoins, and we incentivize strategic
partners to grow distribution and our network. Over the last year, we have expanded our revenue lines
and now earn other revenue from certain of our transaction flows and network infrastructure. And as an
Internet platform business, we have a highly scalable model with strong inherent operating leverage.
Let me now review the quarter. USDC in circulation was $73.7 billion at quarter end, more than doubling
year-on-year and growing faster than the overall market. USDC held within Circle's platform infrastructure
grew nearly 14x year-on-year to $10.2 billion at quarter end, representing 14% of total circulation as
increasingly, we are seeing leading institutions build upon our platform. Reserve return rate was 4.15%
for the third quarter, down 96 basis points year-on-year, reflecting the decline in SOFR during this period.
Total revenue and reserve income increased 66% year-on-year to $740 million for the quarter as growth in
USDC circulation was partly offset by that lower reserve return rate.
Total distribution and transaction and other costs increased 74% year-on-year to $448 million. The
increase was driven primarily by higher average USDC balances held on Coinbase's platform and other
distribution incentives as we continue to build partnerships to drive growth and adoption. RLDC margin
was 39.5% in the quarter, down 270 basis points year-on-year, but strengthening 133 basis points
sequentially from the second quarter, reflecting the impact from growth with certain higher-margin
products and partners. Other revenues, which are high margin and scalable, increased to $29 million from
less than $1 million in the prior year, reflecting the new products and services launched since the second
half of 2024. Subscription and services revenue was $23.6 million in the third quarter, primarily from
revenue from our blockchain network partnerships. We added 5 new chains this quarter and 12 new chains
this year.
Transaction revenue was $4.7 million. Total revenue and reserve income less distribution transaction
and other costs grew 55% year-over-year to $292 million. Adjusted operating expenses, which excludes
depreciation and amortization, digital asset gains and losses and stock-based compensation grew 35%
year-over-year to $131 million for the quarter, as we continue to invest in growing our platform and
distribution at this pivotal time for our industry. Notably, this measure includes payroll taxes, which since
our IPO also includes payroll taxes on stock-based compensation. These new payroll taxes on stock
comp were $5 million in the third quarter. Adjusting for these new payroll taxes to make for a cleaner
comparison, our underlying adjusted operating expenses grew 29% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA
grew 78% year-over-year to $166 million, reflecting the strong operating leverage inherent in our model.
Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded both year-over-year and sequentially to 57%.
Let me conclude with a brief update on our outlook. We are at the beginning of meaningful shifts in the
global markets for money, and we manage our business for long-term success. Moreover, several of

our core performance drivers are visible to the market in real time. As such, we do not give detailed
quarterly or full financial guidance. We do, however, provide full year guidance on certain metrics to help
our investors better understand our expected performance. We will update this guidance when we expect
our performance to materially deviate from that guidance.
Our USDC circulation outlook is long term and through cycle and remains unchanged. We are increasing
other revenue full year 2025 guidance to $90 million to $100 million as a result of strong subscription and
services revenue in Q3 and underlying growth dynamics in transactions revenue. We expect RLDC margin
to end the year around 38% at the high end of our range, reflecting strong on-platform performance.
We are increasing our adjusted operating expenses for the year to $495 million to $510 million, reflecting
growing investments in building our platform capabilities and global partnerships. This also reflects the
impact from payroll taxes related to the potential future exercise of options by Circle employees. Overall,
we've delivered a strong third quarter with meaningful growth and margin expansion. We're only just
beginning to attack the opportunity before us and remain excited about our future. I want to thank the
team here at Circle for your continued hard work and thank our investors and analysts for your support
and engagement.
With that, operator, we can now start the Q&A portion of the call.

Question and Answer
....................................................................................................................................................................
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi.
Peter Corwin Christiansen
Citigroup Inc., Research Division
Really great trends here, pretty impressive, particularly with CPN. I want to double-click into some of the
CPN results. How do you -- how should investors think about the pipeline developing here? You have 55
new partners in review, a huge pipeline of 500. How should we think about the conversion into full users?
And then as a follow-up, if you can give us a sense of how Circle intends to monetize CPN whether directly
or indirectly.
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. Thanks for the question, Pete. This is Jeremy Allaire. Yes. We're very pleased with how CPN is
progressing. Obviously, we announced it in the spring, we went online. We've seen really good traction. A
couple of things I'd say. I think the first is we've really been focused on making sure that we've got great
product and operations that we are confident in that can scale membership and activations. And so we've
made a lot of progress there, and you're sort of seeing that in the results and some of the other data
points that I shared.
For us, this isn't all about total size of the number of members on the network, although we do expect to
continue to grow the total size of the members on the network. But we're focused on adding markets, not
just adding markets for the sake of saying, "Hey, we can flow money here and there." But adding quality
participants, participants that have meaningful flows, participants that want the benefit of a multilateral
framework like this, participants that have good reach into businesses, enterprises, consumer retail, et
cetera.
So sort of quality, not quantity, I would say. And ultimately, we want to make sure and this is part of
the -- when we talk about eligibility and the eligibility reviews, we're looking at a lot of things. We're
looking at how strong is their local liquidity against kind of local banking systems and currencies and their
ability to meet the SLAs of the network and things like that. So we're underwriting for quality, operational
capabilities and the like. And I think we're, again, very pleased with the progression and the progression
of TPV, both the kind of monthly TPV and the annualized TPV run rate that we shared.
Jeremy Fox-Geen
Chief Financial Officer
On monetization, just for the follow-up, I might add a couple of points. The first is to say we're focused
now on growing the network. We're not focused on monetizing the network or extracting value. We want
the network to grow so that it's creating value for all participants in an increasing way, and that's how
networks grow and become valuable. Over time, there are many opportunities for very small fees, which
benefit these new, more efficient Internet scale architectures. You want to charge much lower fees than
traditional models and build businesses at much higher scale.
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
I would just add very quickly, the members on their network can make money. This is -- these are flows
where they have fees for their users and for the businesses that use this and for -- and obviously for
ultimately the kind of currency flows that happen as well. And so this is, I think, an attractive platform
that adds value to these members' products, services and offerings where they can certainly generate
value, and we want to scale that up. So more to come there. I think we're excited about integrating Arc
into CPN and kind of new infrastructure that can support these mainstream payment flows on the network.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Cantwell with Seaport Research.
Jeffrey Brian Cantwell
Seaport Research Partners
I wanted to ask you on -- in October, Chris Waller from the Fed spoke at Payments Innovation Conference.
And he said that this is a new era for the Federal Reserve and payments and that DeFi/crypto world is
no longer on the fringes of the financial system and that the Fed intends to be an active part of that
revolution. Curious what your reaction was to that. And do you think Circle has a seat at that table as the
Fed starts -- likely starts to look more closely at crypto here?
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. So we're 100% in alignment with Governor Waller. And today,
Circle's infrastructure, whether it be our stablecoin network infrastructure, USDC itself, our cross-chain
infrastructure are actually fundamental to this onchain and DeFi based financial system that's emerging.
And in fact, we maintain a very strong leadership position in the DeFi based onchain world. And I think our
competitive strength there has grown over time.
I think the bigger idea, which I think Governor Waller is getting at is that the ability to kind of take what
we think of as the building blocks of the financial system and move those into code and smart contracts
and tokenized assets that run on the Internet is like a wholesale architecture shift, and it represents a
major change in the actual underlying design of the global financial system from digital cash instruments
like stablecoin money to financial contracts and financial market primitives, all expressed in code and that
is at the very heart of the thesis of Circle.
We keep talking about building the Internet financial system. We believe there is a large-scale change
and there will be this large Internet financial system. We see it already sort of forming today. And Circle
intends to be the leading Internet platform company for this new Internet financial system age. So I think
it's very encouraging that the leaders of central banks, that the leaders of global institutions are seeing
this as well and are affecting policy, but also technology and business practices that are really aimed in
this direction.
Jeffrey Brian Cantwell
Seaport Research Partners
Great. Appreciate that. And then a follow-up I had for you is you had 29% market share this quarter. Last
quarter, you had 28% so share stepping up there. Do you mind just talking more about where the share
gains are materializing for you guys? I'm curious if you're seeing any notable change in the U.S. demand
for USDC in particular, post the passing of the GENIUS Act and whether that clarity has been helping out in
any way with the share gains you're seeing here.
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Sure. I'm happy to take that. So we -- as noted, we saw very strong growth in Q3. I think that growth has
come from, yes, the regulatory clarity, but also I think the overall just advancements in the technology
and all of that combined is leading towards more market activity, more major financial institutions,
payments firms, neobanks, large enterprises who are implementing stablecoin in their products and
services. We mentioned a number of major firms that we saw in the quarter. And that -- so that is
effectively a very strong set of tailwinds.
And I think in a world where not just in the U.S. but in Europe, in Asia, in places like Hong Kong, UAE,
where stablecoins are being regulated, the mainstream players who are coming in want to work with an
infrastructure that has the trust, transparency, liquidity and compliance that a firm like Circle has. And so I
think we've long held that kind of infrastructure approach as this becomes a mainstream phenomenon, not
just because of regulation but because of the technology advantages that it would advantage Circle. And I

think as you look at our share gains year-over-year and then the absolute growth in recent periods, I think
it reflects that.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Vafi with Canaccord Genuity.
Joseph Anthony Vafi
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division
Congrats on all the terrific progress. I was wondering if we could kind of drill down a little bit on Arc here.
Number one, Jeremy, I'm pretty excited in your exploration of a native token here. Can you just double-
click on that, what you're looking at, what would be some of the reasons you would move forward with it
versus not and implications both ways? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes, no problem. A couple of things. I think the first, and I mentioned this briefly in my comments as
well, which is Arc Network is being designed and built in collaboration with a lot of major institutions.
And you'll note, if you go and look at the actual Arc announcement, the range of financial infrastructure
companies, global banks, firms in capital markets, asset issuers, asset managers but from all around the
world, from Asia to the Middle East, to Europe, to the United States, to Latin America. And so one of the
fundamental principles is we want a network that is distributed, that has operators from around the world,
from different geographies and geoeconomic systems, and we want to create ways for those participants
including the developers that build applications on Arc and the end users that are driving and growing the
usage of Arc.
We want to create stakeholder incentives, and we want to create governance methods for the evolution of
the network. Now this is, I think, relatively common in the blockchain network space. But I think at this
moment in time, when we're trying to bring together these mainstream companies and leading firms in
the digital asset ecosystem as well, we really see the potential benefit of a native token for Arc that can
provide utility for users of the network that can align incentives around the growth of the network, and
that provides a concrete way for stakeholders to participate in governance around choices in terms of the
technology and its upgrades, choices in terms of the expansion of the operators on the network as well.
And so we're actively evaluating a token for Arc, and we'll share more about that as that comes together.
But I think based on the Arc public testnet launch and the engagement we're seeing from developers
already, we're really excited about this. We think it can be a critical infrastructure for Circle, but also a
critical infrastructure for the entire global ecosystem that are trying to build mainstream scale applications
on these networks and operating systems.
Joseph Anthony Vafi
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division
That's great. Really exciting. And then just what does the intersection -- I know it's early days, the
intersection of CPN and Arc look like at this point or in the near future?
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. So a couple of things. I think the first is that we have -- with Arc now in testnet, we are activating
the Arc as an infrastructure in testnet across all of Circle's products and services. And so during testnet,
we'll continue to make sure that everything is available. We just, I think, announced in the last day, our
tokenized money market fund product USYC went live on Arc testnet. And so we want to make sure that,
that full suite is there.
And then secondly, directly to your question, we think that Arc Network can be a very important

large number of non-dollar currency issuers launching on Arc testnet, and a number of those are already
up and running on the testnet. And so whether these are yen or real or peso or Australian currencies,
other currencies, we want to grow the number of local currencies, and that's important because if we can
establish a seamless, real-time, atomically swappable currency exchange and embed that as a primitive
that can be used by members on CPN, that could be a very powerful capability.
And so Arc as a platform for stablecoin finance and Arc as a sort of enterprise-grade and regulatory-ready
infrastructure for FIs aligns very well with the ultimate goals for CPN. So we -- at the application -- in
other words, the application layer CPN is building on our stablecoin and digital asset network with USDC
and EURC and USYC, and they're all able to build on and take advantage of our operating system with Arc.

Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with Citizens.
Devin Patrick Ryan
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division
A couple of follow-ups here. First, on the Circle Payments Network, obviously, great to see the momentum
in the pipeline there up pretty materially from the last update. Just love to get a sense of kind of the
catalyst to convert that pipeline kind of on the time line. If you can give us anything there, what may close
over the next quarter or 2 versus what is kind of more initial exploratory phase? And then anything on
partnership economics? And then as you do scale the pipeline, do you have the capacity? Or should we
expect to see some more costs come in?
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
I'll take the first part of that and have Jeremy Fox-Geen take the second part of it. Just in terms of the
catalysts, I think building these kind of member-based payment networks is obviously always a classic
chicken and egg, right? You want to make sure that you've got flows on both sides, and so a lot of our
focus, as we have gotten this started is get those quality flows from originators in major markets to
destinations around the world. And we're starting to see that. And I think that's showing up in some of the
numbers that we've also shared.
I think per my earlier comments, more and more firms who are involved in money movement, who are
involved in cross-border money movement, whether they be banks or cross-border payments firms or
even large enterprises that just deal with the complexity of how they collect and remit and move money
for whether it's a creator or a supplier, all of those want to take advantage of the speed and capital
efficiency and cost efficiency of stablecoin infrastructure. And so that's where we're seeing the catalyst.
We're seeing the catalyst from established firms that are seeing that if they can internalize how they move
money, it actually frees up capital, reduces the amount of collateral that they have to have. It creates
more capital efficiency, and it can deliver a faster, better product user experience as well. So those are the
kind of business motivators that people have, and I think, obviously, for us, we're very focused on making
sure that we've got high-quality participants across the network so that by kind of to Metcalfe's Law, every
new node on the network exponentially increases the value of the network.
We want these FIs who are becoming members to immediately feel the benefits and the uplift that they
get bidirectionally as well in using this network. So those are catalysts from a -- what are the business
drivers for people who are coming on and the things -- the kinds of things that we're focused on as we
evaluate onboarding new members. In terms of the kind of outlook for growth on that and/or partnership
models and investments, I'll turn that over to Jeremy Fox-Geen.
Jeremy Fox-Geen
Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. And first, just addressing the cost piece of your question. Obviously, as the network
grows and accelerates its growth, so too are the cost inherent, for example, in onboarding those FIs
through the risk and compliance reviews and ongoing monitoring and things like that. So yes, there will

## Page 12

be more costs associated with that. It's kind of within our overall cost envelope. And as a technology
company, obviously, we're building this in a very scalable infrastructure-driven way with sort of AI
technologies built in wherever possible to ensure that as we scale and grow, we're not doing so by adding
people, we're doing so in a very cost-effective, cost-efficient manner, which is very congruent to our sort
of overall strong operating leverage inherent in every part of our model.
Devin Patrick Ryan
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division
Excellent. And then as a follow-up, obviously, as you're having more conversations with potential partners
and customers and those are scaling pretty materially here, are you learning anything about kind of on
the demand side, anything that could influence kind of the product road map from here? And then kind of
tied to that, there's been a lot of M&A headlines in the space right now. So just if you can touch on kind of
M&A conversations or interest at the moment or even kind of what [ surprises ] you.
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes, sure. So I would say a couple of kind of things thematically. I think a critical need that firms that are
looking to build on stablecoin payments, they're looking for strong direct liquidity between the stablecoin
and the stablecoin network and local markets. And so that's been a key focus for us basically ensuring that
our liquidity network is as strong as possible. We mint and redeem at scale through major financial market
centers around the world. We're increasing the number of significant banks that are kind of plugged into
our infrastructure in these major markets. And sort of if you think about that, that sort of like the width
and the efficiency of the pipes, how efficient and cost efficient is it to be able to move capital through
those pipes.
And so that's been a big differentiator for us. And I think we're now able to build on top of that these
other abstractions, whether they be FX abstractions, settlement credit abstractions, the CPN orchestration
coordination capabilities, and then obviously, for many of the firms who are -- this is new to them. This is
-- there's the digital asset native ecosystem who are leaning in. And then there's all these firms that are
new to this. This is really where technologies like Arc come in and a big motivator for us with Arc is we've
looked for years at what does it take for a traditional FI or traditional enterprise to build an application,
deploy it to use these networks and to do that in a simple, safe and well assured process as possible.
So with Arc, for example, deterministic settlement finality in subsecond transaction costs of around $0.01.
The fees paid on the network are actually in USDC and other stablecoins over time. And so confidentiality
features, these are critical features that people need to make this work for them. And this is really the
classic evolution from an earlier adopter set of technology infrastructure, an early adopter mentality, which
has largely been focused on speculating and a mainstream scaling phase where the infrastructure needs
to map to the mainstream needs. And I think those are the things that we're doing up and down the entire
product stack, not just in CPN, but the entire product stack that we're building for all of these mainstream
institutions around the world who are looking to build on this infrastructure.
Jeremy Fox-Geen
Chief Financial Officer
And then just taking the M&A part of your question. When we've talked about M&A and our internal M&A
strategy, right, we see M&A as -- and its use as accelerative to our core offerings. So we have offerings in
the blockchain space, in the digital asset space and then in the application space on top of all of those with
the Circle Payments Network. We've done 3 deals, closed 3 deals so far this year, and we would expect to
continue to do M&A to accelerate within each of those spaces. We do not anticipate using M&A to diversify
for diversification's sake.
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
One last comment there is we've been building infrastructure in this whole space for a very long time. And
so -- and there are other firms who want to be in the space but need to catch up. And so naturally, you're

sort of seeing people who are trying to find teams and technology and other things out there. We've built
everything that we do historically, more or less organically. As Jeremy noted, we've acquired IP and teams
and others, and we'll continue to look at opportunities as noted. But we feel very good about our kind of
innovation curve itself and our direct IP generation. We actually recently noted that we had 25 patents
generated from the novel engineering and research and development of Circle.

Your next question comes from the line of John Todaro with Needham.
John Todaro
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division
Congrats on the results here. I guess I have one and a follow-up. First, on the on-platform performance,
I think we've been continuously pretty pleasantly surprised with the USDC on Circle platform here up to
$10.2 billion. I'm just trying to frame this up. I would think most of this is for payments, cross-border
money movement versus kind of crypto native. Any kind of maybe percentages or just framing that up
and give us a little bit more color. Is that the right way to think about it that, that moves more towards
some of the payment verticals versus some of the crypto-native stuff? And then I have a follow-up on Arc.
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Sure. So John, we don't break out the on-platform by, say, use case directly. But what I can say is for
Circle, what we've been focused on is building partnerships with firms that want to build on top of our
technology stack ideally end-to-end on our technology stack, taking advantage of our wallets, our Circle
Mint, our core liquidity and increasingly these other developer services and infrastructure like CPN. So
we've very much focused on firms that want to build on our infrastructure. And we focus on building
partnerships with firms that are going to be growth oriented, meaning we want to have -- we want to do
deals with and build strong economic relationships with firms who have a credible path to driving growth.
And so those have been the focuses. And I think when we look at the partnerships that have helped us
grow on platform, they all fit that criteria overall. And I think in some cases -- just to give you a little bit
more color, in some cases, these are partnerships with firms that have tens or hundreds of millions of
users, and those users are oftentimes in what I'll kind of call like financial super apps, where they offer
wallets, they offer payments, they offer trading, investing and other things. And so we don't see through
into the -- all of the behavior of their users and how much of it is for peer-to-peer transfers versus
investments and other things as well. So -- but the nature of this is we're really going after partnerships
with platforms that have good distribution and are growth oriented in what they can do with us.
John Todaro
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division
That's very helpful. And then my follow-up on Arc. As you mentioned, the fees are paid in USDC and other
stablecoins and then also just those transaction fees are so de minimis. And I can't imagine a token would
be for gas fees or anything of that like. You kind of framed it up as maybe like a governance token. Is
that the right way to think about it? And I know it's early, but just maybe some more of the potential like
economic accrual or utility outside of -- yes, I guess just what would the other potential utility be if it's not
for the gas side?
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. So a couple of things. I think as I said earlier, we're looking broadly at utility, economic incentives,
stakeholder participation and governance across the full ecosystem that will engage with Arc. And we are
exploring a token for Arc Network that aligns with trying to accomplish all those things. But there's not a
lot more I can say right now. Certainly, as we continue this exploration, we'll be able to share considerably
more assuming that, that continues to go well.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research.
Kenneth Christopher Suchoski
Autonomous Research US LP
I wanted to ask about the other revenue. I think subscription revenue stepped up nicely quarter-over-
quarter. So how much of that is driven by adding the 5 new chains that you talked about versus some of
the other recurring revenue sources. And then maybe on the transaction revenue within other revenue,
I think that ticked down slightly quarter-over-quarter despite showing really strong growth across the
various metrics. So maybe a little more detail on why the decline quarter-over-quarter?
Jeremy Fox-Geen
Chief Financial Officer
Thank you for the question. There's a lot that goes on in this. So let me try and unpick some of the
pieces. Yes, the sort of, as you said, strong growth in subscription and services revenue, primarily that is
revenues from our blockchain network partnerships. As I think we said before, that revenue stream has
2 components that are upfront revenues from the various integrations that we do. And then there are
ongoing revenues for maintaining those. Now the pace and progress of the upfront can depend upon a
whole number of different factors. And so we've historically, and we'll do so, again, describe that business
as lumpy.
And so we had a very strong quarter, and we had a long pipeline of fees, and we've been working very,
very hard to execute upon those. And so the upfront fees is the largest part of that bucket, but we're
seeing strong growth in the underlying recurring revenues within subscription services, which we're very
happy about. You note the decline in transaction revenues rightly from $5.8 million last quarter to $4.7
million this quarter, and then you comment on the underlying growth of so many other things. There's a
wide variety of elements within transaction revenues. And yes, we are seeing strong underlying growth in
many of them.
The decline quarter-on-quarter is best thought of as a spike in the prior quarter, a spike in redemption
revenues associated with our USYC tokenized money market fund product. After we have made that
acquisition, we repositioned that product to be used as collateral within the digital asset markets. And
through that repositioning, we saw a very large amount of redemptions, leading to a spike in redemption
fees in the second quarter which masks the underlying growth trends in the other products and services
within that. Notably, USYC itself has returned to growth. It has grown at 200% from the end of last
quarter to today and now stands as the second largest tokenized money fund product in the world.
Kenneth Christopher Suchoski
Autonomous Research US LP
Great. That's helpful, Jeremy. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the implied 4Q guide
just because we're getting a few questions on it. For RLDC, I think there's some assumptions we all have
to make there. But I think to reach the full year guide that implies quite a bit of sequential step down
in margins, maybe you could talk about what's driving the step down. We would have thought that the
performance on Circle, on platform USDC and then some of the other revenue at a high margin that RLDC
margins would actually improve over time. But maybe there's some dynamics in the market related to
rewards and distribution costs. So any thoughts there? Any help there would be very helpful.
Jeremy Fox-Geen
Chief Financial Officer
Thank you. And that's a great question. And again, I'm going to say there's a lot of different pieces
moving around in the underlying there, which could -- can make it quite difficult to unpick. We're very
pleased to have seen strong sequential RLDC revenues against a backdrop over the last few years of that
declining. We've long said that networks have network effects, and we see this both in sort of growth of
our off-platform USDC and in certain of our economic agreements. There can be some lumpiness within
those, which kind of gets to the point on the guidance.

On our philosophy to guidance overall, we've consistently said that we want to be as clear and transparent
with you as we have line of sight into. So we take a sort of modestly conservative posture. We don't bake
in everything we hope is going to happen or everything we're working on, and we're working on an awful

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho.
Dan Dolev
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division
So yes, overall, really strong 3Q. Kind of touching on that question from before. I mean, if the [ bull ]
case is the TAM is growing and that could have set rate declines, you do seem to -- I mean you're talking
about guiding down Q4 other income and expenses are rising. I don't think we've heard like a really good
explanation. But maybe my bigger question is what would be the pushback to the skeptics in the industry
who are saying, look, this is somewhat of a commoditized thing. I think even the networks are saying
there's going to be a lot of stablecoins. Like what would make USDC win in this market long term? So
maybe like a shorter-term question on this Q4 guide and then longer-term, more conceptual question
would be great.
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Dan, this is Jeremy. Thanks for the question. I'll actually take the second part first. I think there's a
fundamental misunderstanding in the market. And I think that there is a sort of -- there's a view that, hey,
anyone can kind of pop out a stablecoin, and therefore, if it's a big company that pops out a stablecoin,
that it's automatically going to be successful. We've actually seen the opposite historically. We've seen
consortiums of major companies launch stablecoin products that effectively had 0 circulation. We've seen
very large players with huge numbers of users, push, push, push on this to get very, very little traction.
And I think the misunderstanding is that stablecoin networks are like other Internet platform utilities,
meaning they have network effects, and those network effects come from the number of products and
services and integrations to the network. And so if I'm building a product and I want to support stablecoin
settlements and stablecoin payments, you're at a disadvantage if you don't support USDC because it has
so much interoperability around the world. And we see that all the time.
We see major B2B firms adding USDC as the payment option without a deal with Circle, without any
relationship with Circle, they're doing it because it's got the most reach and interoperability. So there's
sort of the network utility, that also ties to what I would describe as developer flywheels, which is
developers want to build and integrate to things that are going to help them themselves provide utility
directly to their users. And so the reach of the network and the utility of the network compound each
other.
And then the other piece, which is I think also not as well understood is that these digital currencies live
and breathe by the liquidity that exists around them. And so we have focused years on building the best,
most widely integrated liquidity network for USDC, primary liquidity in major banking systems around
the world, as well as secondary market liquidity so that it exists on brokerages, exchanges, payment
apps, wallets, through banks and others around the world. That primary and secondary liquidity is also
something with network effects. If you want to do something and know that your counterparty is going to
be able to be liquid in it and utilize it, that liquidity is really key.
So those are big -- those are very big, I think, and very powerful network effects. And I think the last
piece of this is that there are also important kind of regulatory and infrastructure moats that exist, which
is that it's a huge undertaking to ensure that you are well integrated and supervised by central banking
regimes around the world. And that's something that we've done the hard work on with over 55 licenses
activated in more markets, bringing more markets online. And so the infrastructure from that, the risk
infrastructure from that and then all these other network effects are really important.

CIRCLE INTERNET GROUP, INC. FQ3 2025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 12, 2025
And I think it explains the fact that we have continued to grow at the pace we have, that the amount of
growth we've seen in the onchain markets, in total transaction volumes and what Visa characterizes as
"real payment volumes," we've grown, and we've grown our share and despite there being more and more
players. And so I think as we look out over the next 1, 2, 3, 4 quarters, you're going to see a lot of noise
from a lot of people who think, "Oh, I need to do a stablecoin." And I think you're going to be able to
measure those every single day. And I would encourage people to measure the actual trading liquidity that
exists in these other tokens, the actual number of wallets that hold these other tokens and the distribution
that's there. And I think we're going to continue to see what we've seen.
This is a winner-take-most market structure. It's not a winner-take-all market structure, but it's a winner-
take-most market structure. And I think that the investments that you're seeing, and I'm kind of bleeding
into maybe JFG's other part of your question, Dan, we are leaning into this. We're seeing growth in major
platform developments that we think are critical to winning the Internet platform game in this space.
And we're seeing a lot of commercial tailwinds all around the world in every region, commercial tailwinds
because of the technology progress and regulatory clarity. And we want to make sure that we are stepping
into that opportunity so that we can continue to be an outsized winner in this kind of upgrade of the
financial system to the Internet.
Jeremy Fox-Geen
Chief Financial Officer
Yes, thank you Jeremy. You hit on all the major points in there. Just one small follow-up on the piece
about guidance. We are at the beginning of what can best really only be described as a megatrend,
right? The growth and the building of the Internet financial system, bringing Internet capabilities and
architectures into the world of money. And as you noted, Dan, right, the addressable markets here are
huge. We don't give full year or quarterly financial guidance other than on a few key metrics for that
reason. Whenever you see an exponential growth curve and you zoom into the detail, particularly at the
early end of that curve, you see a lot of fluctuations and variations. And we think that those shorter-term
fluctuations are best described as missing the forest for the trees if one was to overly focus on them.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with William Blair.
Adib Hasan Choudhury
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
This is Adib Choudhury on for Andrew. Building out some prior questions, it sounds like maybe you're
somewhat agnostic to a specific base case around USDC and focus more on distribution. But if you have to
pick, I guess, what's the most imminent use case beyond crypto trading in your view? And what's sort of
the near-term visibility you have around USDC for non-crypto activity taking off?
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Absolutely. Great question. So we are definitely not agnostic to the use cases of USDC. However, what we
do often say is stablecoin money is increasingly a general purpose, general architecture form of money
that is being used across a very wide range of use cases, everything from small agent to agent payments,
to large capital markets transactions between major electronic markets firms, to everything in between.
We're -- obviously, we're seeing major consumer retail acceptance platforms like Stripe and Shopify
making an out-of-the-box feature for payment acceptance.
But very specifically, to get to the heart of your question, [ Andrew, ] I think we are seeing growth in
cross-border and international payments with stablecoins, that has been a driver for quite some time,
and it continues to drive growth that led to us building out an entire new pillar of our business with CPN,

where we're seeing mainstream flows, wanting to use this as a superior money movement system. And
so that is very much a driver of activity and growth and partnerships when I look at the partnerships that
we're forming around the world, there are many in that space. And we're even seeing some of the biggest
systemically important banks leaning into that to actually improve upon the way in which they do their
own international money movement.
We're seeing large enterprises who are looking at internal treasury management and how they can move
money across geographies and deal with collections and disbursements across global markets as a growth
driver. And then we've talked in the past as well about sort of digital dollar as store of value. So we
continue to see demand for both firms and households who want to hold USDC, and I think that if you
look back at the GENIUS Act and really one of the goals that Secretary Bessent and other kind of, I think,
promoters of that breakthrough in federal law, it really is about how do we kind of continue to export the
dollar in these powerful ways. So we're certainly seeing those. And then I think we're also starting to see,
and this is, I think, something to kind of watch this space closely is traditional financial markets embracing
stablecoins.
So traditional financial markets like clearing houses, derivatives exchanges that want to be able to use
stablecoins as collateral for relative margin and for settlement as an improvement over the way that
works versus the traditional banking system. So we're seeing that. We're seeing big pushes around that.
We're seeing regulatory pushes around that. And you've seen us announce partnerships with the likes of
Intercontinental Exchange, Deutsche Börse Group and others and that's something that we are pressing
on. And related to that is essentially the number of traditional financial institutions that are launching
smart contracts and digital tokens, i.e., tokenized forms of investment products that already exist.
And virtually, every one of those products uses USDC as its primary cash leg and settlement leg. And
so you have firms like a Zero Hash who works with us quite a bit. And they face off against a lot of
these tokenized issuers, for example, and driving the use of USDC there. So it is diverse, but we are not
agnostic. We are leaning into the places where we're seeing both the most immediate product market fit
and traction. And then also the -- where we're seeing pull from the market to -- where parts of the market
are really wanting to implement this infrastructure.
And I cannot underscore how significant the GENIUS Act has been in terms of unlocking major institutions
willingness to start embracing and using this technology. And there's a knock-on effect with regulators
around the world who are also looking to conform and ensure that well-regulated issue products like USDC
can work in their local markets as well, which is driving institutional access and demand in those global
geographies also.

Your next question comes from the line of James Yaro with Goldman Sachs.
James Edwin Yaro
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
I just wanted to follow up on the prior question. I'd love to just get a sense perhaps quantitatively if
there's any ability to contextualize how much USDC is being used in those use cases outside of crypto
trading, DeFi and developing market access to dollars, specifically the 2 use cases, which you just talked
about are payments and capital markets. So are we seeing -- is there any ability to sort of size how much
is being used there and perhaps you can compare it versus the IPO? Or is this all on the comp?
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
So there is certainly growth happening in these cross-border use cases. And in fact, I think there's some
good third-party reporting on this. There's a third-party analyst firm Artemis which has recently published,
I think, some of the best data on growth in business-to-business payments, international business-to-
business payments and the growth through these periods, I think I don't know what the ending period.
The ending period is pretty recent, is very strong. I think it's reflective of what we're seeing in the
partnerships that we're forming in the cross-border related payment space.

We don't break out across our entire -- the entirety of our transactions that, although almost by definition,
CPN flows are that because of the construct of the product. But the uses of USDC in international
settlements go well beyond what is happening just inside of CPN. So we don't break it out, but there are,
I think, very good third parties who are looking across the entire ecosystem, not just Circle to size that
growth and activation.
James Edwin Yaro
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Okay. I'd just like to touch on the potential that stablecoins could become interest-bearing in Congress'
market structure bill. How should we think about the impacts on your business if interest were permitted?
Jeremy D. Allaire
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
So I think the key issue here is specifically not that stablecoins would become interest-bearing, I don't
think there's anyone who's looking at revising the GENIUS Act and the prohibition on stablecoin issuers
being able to pay interest. I think what's that -- what's in discussion, I should say, in the market structure
legislation is whether or not distributors of stablecoins, exchanges, brokerages, other wallet products have
the ability to use rewards as an incentive for people to use stablecoins on their platforms. And that is
permitted under the GENIUS Act, and I think there's a real push from other parts of the industry, not the
digital asset side of the industry to amend not the GENIUS Act, but to provide provisions in the market
structure bill, which would allow these stablecoin distributors to continue this practice of offering rewards.
I think -- we think that the language in the GENIUS Act is very good. We think it creates a balanced
approach here, and it keeps -- importantly, it keeps stablecoins considered as cash and cash equivalent
instruments, which is vital from a financial markets perspective, from prudential supervisory perspective
as well. But I think we also believe that there should be business model innovation in these kind of
distribution platforms for how they engage with their customers. And so I think we're also supportive of
the industry's view on that as well.

Yes. It's a very good question, and it relates to something I shared earlier, which is that we have a very
powerful global utility that, in some ways, people can't afford not to support and integrate with. If you're
building a product that wants to be interoperable in this world, you need to support USDC. And if you need
a -- if you want a product that can easily move value in and out, the liquidity of USDC is essential. So we
do have, I think, as noted, very strong network effects. And when we think about partnerships, as I said
earlier, we're very focused on -- we will invest in, so to speak, growth incentives with partners who can
grow distribution. That's where we're focused.

And we know today that our network and capabilities is essential for most products that are out there. And
-- but at the same time, yes, we are trying to construct win-win partnerships with firms. But a very large
number of the major brands that you see supporting USDC, there's not a direct economic incentive at
all. These are just people who are choosing us because we are the most trusted, transparent, compliant,
liquid, globally available in the world.
