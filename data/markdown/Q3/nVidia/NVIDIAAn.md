## Conference Call and Webcast Information
NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2025 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2025.

## Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

## About NVIDIA

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.

Certain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the age of AI in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing; demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — being incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training and inference; AI transforming every industry, company and country; enterprises adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows; industrial robotics investments surging with breakthroughs in physical AI; countries awakening to the importance of developing their national AI and infrastructure; NVIDIA’s next quarterly cash dividend; and NVIDIA’s financial outlook and expected tax rates for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 are risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include:
- global economic conditions;
- our reliance on third parties to manufacture, assemble, package and test our products;
- the impact of technological development and competition;
- development of new products and technologies or enhancements to our existing product and technologies;
- market acceptance of our products or our partners’ products;
- design, manufacturing or software defects;
- changes in consumer preferences or demands;
- changes in industry standards and interfaces;
- unexpected loss of performance of our products or technologies when integrated into systems, as well as other factors detailed from time to time in the most recent reports NVIDIA files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including, but not limited to, its annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

Copies of reports filed with the SEC are posted on the company’s website and are available from NVIDIA without charge.
