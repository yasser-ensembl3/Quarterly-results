- As Blackwell ramps, expect gross margins to moderate to the low 70s
- When fully ramped, expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid 70s

- **Operating Expense**: Approximately $4.8 billion GAAP and $3.4 billion non-GAAP

- **Other Income & Expense**: Income of approximately $400 million for GAAP and non-GAAP
