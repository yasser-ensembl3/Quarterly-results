Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance
To supplement the company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, or GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures
include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate,
free cash flow and figures in this press release presented on an "FX-Neutral basis." These non-GAAP financial measures are presented on a
continuing operations basis.
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different
from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of
accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company's
results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate the company's results of
operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
Reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release, except for figures in this press release
presented on an “FX-Neutral basis,” can be found in the tables included in this press release. For figures in this press release reported on an
"FX-Neutral basis,” the company calculates the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates,
excluding hedging activity, applied to current year transactional currency amounts.
These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and its
prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and
investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, or net purchases of property and equipment, as the case may be, that may not be
indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because the company has historically reported certain non-GAAP results
to investors, the company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.
For its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, the company's management uses financial measures that do not include
stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, amortization or impairment of acquired intangible
assets, impairment of goodwill, amortization of deferred tax assets associated with the realignment of its legal structure and related foreign
exchange effects, significant gains or losses from the disposal/acquisition of a business, certain gains and losses on investments including
changes in fair value, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of any related foreign exchange derivative instruments, gains
or losses associated with a warrant agreement that the company entered into with Adyen, restructuring-related charges and the income taxes
associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, the company's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP
measures in reviewing the financial results of the company.
The company excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income and
margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:
Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes. This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted
stock and employee stock purchases. The company excludes stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily
because they are non-cash expenses that management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. The related employer
payroll taxes are dependent on the company's stock price and the vesting of restricted stock by employees and the timing and size of stock
option exercises, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to the
company's operation of the business.
Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, certain amortization of deferred tax assets and related
foreign exchange effects, significant gains or losses and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and certain
gains or losses on investments. The company incurs amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection
with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore excludes these
amounts from its non-GAAP measures. The company also excludes certain gains and losses on investments. The company excludes the
non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets associated with the realignment of its legal structure, which is not reduced by the effects of
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and related foreign exchange effects. The company excludes these items because management does not
believe they correlate to the ongoing operating results of the company's business.
Restructuring. These charges consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. The company excludes
significant restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.
Other certain significant gains, losses, or charges that are not indicative of the company’s core operating results. These are significant
gains, losses, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the
past and are not expected to occur regularly or be repeated in the future. The company excludes these amounts from its results primarily
because management does not believe they are indicative of its current or ongoing operating results. These amounts include changes in
fair value and the related change in foreign currency exchange rates of equity securities with readily determinable fair values, globally.
Change in fair market value of warrants. These are gains or losses associated with warrant agreements entered into with vendors, which
are attributable to changes in fair value during the period.
Income tax effects and adjustments. We use a non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating our operating results. Based on our current long-term
projections, we are using a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5%. This non-GAAP tax rate could change for various reasons including significant
changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate.
In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, the company also uses free cash flow. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows
less purchases of property and equipment. The company considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to
management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment,
which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the company's business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase stock and pay
dividends. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or
decrease in the company's cash balance for the period and does not exclude certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt
service requirements.
