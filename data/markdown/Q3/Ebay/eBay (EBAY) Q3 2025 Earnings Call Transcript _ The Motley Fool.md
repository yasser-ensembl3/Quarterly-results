Peggy Alford stated, "we saw a deceleration in year-over-year volume growth
starting in September in key markets importing into the U.S. after the removal of the
de minimis exemption."
Alford indicated that transaction losses were up 19% in Q3 2025. This was due to
"higher consumer protection losses that were due to the ramp of the UK managed
shipping program as well as some unfavorable fluctuations in buyer and seller
fraud."
Management expects to face a full quarter of impact from the removal of the global
de minimis exemption in Q4 2025, compared to only a single month in Q3, which will
contribute to a modest deceleration in GMV growth.
Alford forecasted that, net interest income will become a headwind to year-over-year
earnings growth in Q4 2025 due to prevailing interest rates and a lower cash

balance.

Capital Allocation -- Plans to return approximately $3 billion to shareholders in 2025,
aiming for 90%-100% of normalized free cash flow through buybacks and dividends
in typical years.
2026 Early Outlook -- Expect a third consecutive year of FX neutral GMV and
revenue growth in 2026; anticipate a two-point GMV headwind from lapping 2025
performance in trading cards, bullion/coins, and marketing efficiency, plus a one-
point headwind from de minimis changes.
Summary
eBay (EBAY (/quote/nasdaq/ebay/) +1.43%) reported 8% FX neutral GMV growth to
$20.1 billion and 8% FX neutral revenue growth to $2.82 billion, driven primarily by
gains in focus categories and the U.S. market in Q3 2025. Non-GAAP operating
income rose 9% year over year to $764 million, and non-GAAP EPS increased over
14% to $1.36, while the company returned nearly $760 million to shareholders.
Management guided for continued but moderating growth in Q4 as the full effect of

## Page 5

18/12/2025 12:37 eBay (EBAY) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | The Motley Fool
de minimis exemption removal, trading card comps, and other lapping factors are
expected to pressure sequential results. This guidance reflects management's
expectations for FX neutral growth between 4%-6% year over year. Strategic
investments in AI, live commerce, fashion collaborations, shipping, vehicles, and
emerging verticals remain central priorities, with further international expansions in
live shopping and enhanced cross-border shipping solutions for sellers. Cost
increases reflect heavier product development, transaction losses, and continued
resource allocation to reinforce strategic growth vector resilience amid evolving
trade policy headwinds in Q3 2025.
Management noted active buyers rose to 134 million, with annual spend per
enthusiast buyer exceeding $3,200 on a trailing twelve-month basis as of Q3 2025,
but flagged that macroeconomic pressures outside the U.S. constrained
international GMV growth.

The CFO said, Vehicle volume has seen significant quarter-over-quarter growth
since launch earlier this year. But the contribution to total volume is still very modest
as we expected," and added Carmel's effective take rate will be "low to mid-single-
digit range when including both the buy-side and the sell-side monetization."
Legacy third-party display ads revenue continued to decline—down 40% to $7 million
—while first-party ads grew nearly 23% and off-platform ads rose 32% to $22 million
in Q3 2025.
AI-enabled features such as Magical Listings and unified agentic commerce
platforms are credited with accelerating inventory uploads and personalizing buying
experiences, enhancing overall marketplace efficiency.
Peggy Alford highlighted that transaction losses were up 19% in Q3 2025, mostly
due to the UK managed shipping ramp and unfavorable fluctuations, without
indicating the trend was a structural issue.
The Q4 2025 revenue and GMV outlook assumes stronger take rates partially
countered by mix shift, full-quarter de minimis impact, and seasonal changes in

category and ASP mix over the holidays.
Plans to return $3 billion to shareholders in 2025 and a medium-term target to
repurchase and distribute 90%-100% of normalized free cash flow through buybacks
and dividends were reiterated.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Jamie Iannone, our Chief Executive Officer, and Peggy Alford, our Chief Financial
Officer. We are providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary during
the call, which is available through the Investor Relations section of the eBay Inc.
website at investors.ebayinc.com. Before we begin, I will remind you that during this
conference call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures related to our
performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest
comparable GAAP measures in our accompanying slide presentation. Additionally,
all growth rates noted in our prepared remarks will reflect FX neutral year-over-year
comparisons, and all earnings per share amounts reflect earnings per diluted share
unless indicated otherwise.
During this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements
including, without limitation, statements regarding our future performance and
×
expected financial results. These forward-looking statements involve known and
unknown risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from our
forecast for a variety of reasons. You can find more information about risks,
uncertainties, and other factors that could affect our operating results in our most
recent periodic reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and our earnings release from
earlier today. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information
in this presentation is as of 10/29/2025. We do not intend and undertake no duty to
update this information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie.
Jamie Iannone: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us
today. I'm pleased to report we delivered better than expected results across our key
financial metrics in Q3. Our gross merchandise volume grew 8% to $20.1 billion.
Revenue increased by over 8% to $2.82 billion, and our non-GAAP earnings per share
grew over 14% year over year to $1.36. We achieved these strong top and bottom
line results amid continued macroeconomic challenges across our international
markets and increased headwinds for cross-border trade into the U.S. Now let's go
deeper into the key drivers behind our strong Q3 performance. Focused category

GMV growth accelerated to over 15% in Q3, outpacing the remainder of our
marketplace by roughly 11 percentage points.
This growth was broad-based as all of our focus categories grew positively year
over year with most accelerating sequentially. Although we expect the level of
growth in focus categories to normalize in the near future, our momentum speaks to
the level of innovation we've driven for customers, and the increased likelihood that
enthusiasts consider eBay Inc. when shopping in these categories. Within our focus
categories, collectibles was the largest contributor to growth, driven by another
quarter of accelerating year-over-year GMV growth in both collectible card games
and sports trading cards. Our off-platform marketplaces, TCG Player and Golden,
also saw GMV accelerate sequentially.
Pokemon GMV grew in the triple digits year over year for the third straight quarter,
benefiting from a strong product release cadence. We believe our continued
×
momentum in trading cards is a direct result of the trust and innovation we've driven
for hobbyists in recent years with features like My Collection, AI-powered listing
tools, authentication and grading, consignment partnerships, and integrated PSA
population data. We've added new ways to buy and connect with other enthusiasts
through eBay Live. We've also benefited from a consistent drumbeat of activations
at major tentpole events like New York Comic Con and the National Card Collectors
Convention where we had our biggest presence ever this year.
While we do not expect GMV growth in this category to be linear every quarter,
particularly as we face more challenging comps starting in Q4, we are confident in a
long runway for secular growth in trading cards. Motors, Parts and Accessories, or
P&A, was our second largest contributor to GMV growth in Q3, generating more than
one point for the overall marketplace. The introduction of easy and free returns in
the U.S. continued to build upon our trusted value proposition in P&A.
While the cost and return rates for this program are well within our forecasted
ranges, we continue to expand choice and selection in key inventory segments, such
as salvage and used parts, which help consumers find value at a time when many
https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/10/29/ebay-ebay-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/ 8/36



## Page 9

18/12/2025 12:37 eBay (EBAY) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | The Motley Fool
are stretched financially. Overall, we have over 750 million live P&A listings, which
enables us to offer the largest online selection of unique auto parts and accessories
in most of our major markets. Fashion was another notable driver of GMV growth in
Q3, led by our luxury, streetwear, and pre-loved apparel focused categories. In Q3,
we reinforced our commitment to the circular economy through a collaboration with
Marks and Spencer, one of the UK's most iconic retail brands.
UK consumers can now drop off used clothing at Marks and Spencer stores. The
program keeps quality fashion in circulation by repairing, cleaning, and reselling
wearable items and responsibly recycling the rest. We're excited by the potential of
this partnership to unlock more pre-loved clothing on eBay Inc., extend the lifespan
of high-quality products, and raise awareness of our growing role in driving the
circular economy. In September, we expanded our authenticity program in the UK to
cover 70 luxury and premium brands in apparel, shoes, and accessories, building
upon our existing offerings in sneakers, watches, handbags, and fine jewelry.
×
This makes the UK our first market where luxury items can be authenticated from
head to toe, reducing buyer friction and unlocking more high-value transactions
across premium brands. eBay Live continues to build momentum, with consistent
quarter-over-quarter growth across every major key performance indicator we track,
including viewers, watch time, sold items, and GMV. In recent weeks, eBay Live's
annual GMV run rate was up approximately five times year over year. We've created
more personalized entry points into eBay Live across our homepage, search, and
view item pages, making it easier for our scaled buyer base to discover and join live
shopping events that speak directly to their passions.
In Q3, we hosted some incredible eBay Live shopping events in the U.S. The
Backstreet Boys joined Paradise Card Breaks at the eBay Open in Las Vegas. We
had Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo and his brothers join Ken
Golden for a memorable event at the National. Ken also teamed up with Logan Paul
for a high-end sports card box break which drew approximately 20,000 viewers over
a multi-hour stream. eBay Live is also gaining strong traction in the UK following its
formal launch in May at Comic Con London.

Since then, we've seen a consistent cadence of exciting live shopping events, from a
Love Island charity auction stream and eBay's endless runway event at London
Fashion Week, to Pokemon weekend, and new channels for toys and memorabilia.
In September, SharkNinja also hosted our first refurbished appliance sales event
with great success. It's exciting to see how quickly eBay Live is building cultural
relevance and meaningful engagement with enthusiasts across the UK. Overall,
we're thrilled by the response we're seeing from sellers and buyers on eBay Live and
see significant potential for live commerce to become a strategic growth vector for
our marketplace.
Improvements to our consumer-to-consumer, or C2C, proposition in key
geographies represent another strategic growth factor for our business. One year
after we launched our UK C2C initiative, we continue to see compelling results. In
2025, we saw UK C2C GMV growth remain well above our prelaunch baseline. As we
introduced a buyer-facing fee, and ramped adoption of our managed shipping
×
program, which streamlines the shipping process, reduces cost, and improves trust.
In Q3, we introduced additional C2C changes including faster payouts for long-
tenured sellers, greater transparency into all-in pricing when sellers are listing items
and negotiating offers, and more competitive terms for items priced below 20
British pounds.
As a result, we saw UK customer satisfaction improve notably alongside
accelerating year-over-year GMV growth during the quarter. We recently added
shipping support for bulky and heavy items through DHL. And we exited Q3 with the
majority of UK C2C transactions utilizing our managed shipping program, which is
now mandated for all eligible items. Earlier this month, we closed the acquisition of
Ties, a leading social marketplace in the Nordics focused on pre-loved fashion and
lifestyle goods. Ties has built a highly engaged Gen Z and millennial community and
a strong track record in social community-led commerce.
This acquisition strengthens our leadership in the circular economy, increases our
presence in the Nordic markets, and accelerates our work to make consumer selling
more seamless, trusted, and scalable. I'm excited to welcome the Ties team to eBay

Inc. and I look forward to our teams learning from each other as we drive innovation
for enthusiasts and accelerate the circular economy. Our years of investment in
artificial intelligence have enabled us to leverage our scale and three decades of
commercially relevant data and insights to transform the eBay Inc. experience for
customers. In recent years, we've utilized generative AI to dramatically improve the
selling experience on eBay Inc. through progressive iterations of our magical listing
technology.
In addition to selling, we've been testing a variety of agentic experiences in search
and shopping to learn how buyers and sellers engage with AI at different phases of
the customer journey. This includes both on eBay Inc. agentic experiences like our
AI shopping agent pilot, and third-party agents from companies like OpenAI. Our AI
shopping agent has given buyers a new way to shop across our inventory, with
personalized product picks and expert guidance, based on their individual shopping
preferences. As the pilot has progressed, we've significantly improved the
×
underlying technology powering the experience.
For example, we were able to build hyper-optimized large language models in-house
that perform specific shopping agent tasks at lower latency and for significantly
reduced costs versus commercial models. With these learnings and efficiency
improvements, we're now poised to gradually bring agentic capabilities into the core
of eBay Inc.'s business through the main search experience over the coming
quarters. Our early learnings have also guided the development of our unified
agentic commerce platform, which integrates our hybrid cloud infrastructure, large
language model ecosystem, our model context protocol server, and other agentic
proprietary data layers.
This platform enables a fully connected experience between eBay Inc. agents and
generalized third-party agents from companies like OpenAI, which allows us to
service the most personalized and relevant products to shoppers in real-time based
on our thirty years of listings, pricing, transactions, and behavior signals. We believe
this platform will enable us to deliver more personalized, seamless, and trusted
experiences for eBay Inc. buyers regardless of where they started their shopping
https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/10/29/ebay-ebay-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/ 11/36



## Page 12

18/12/2025 12:37 eBay (EBAY) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | The Motley Fool
journey. With these capabilities now in place, we are well-positioned to continue
improving the on eBay Inc. experience with agentic tools touching more of the end-
to-end shopping journey but also connect to compelling third-party agentic
experiences.
I'm also excited to see how easy and seamless it is to shop on eBay Inc. using the
iPhone camera after our recent integration into Apple's Visual Intelligent feature in
iOS 26. Now, when a user takes a photo or screenshot of a product they'd like to
shop for online, they can quickly surface relevant listings on eBay Inc., helping more
iOS users discover our breadth and depth of unique inventory in an intuitive
experience. iPhone users can also take advantage of a great new feature for
auctions after we launched live activities functionality on iOS in September, which
gives bidders real-time updates directly on their phone's lock screen during the final
ten minutes of an eBay Inc. auction.
×
This engaging feature has seen click-through rates more than four times higher than
our standard push notifications for auction listings, helping ensure buyers never
miss a chance to bid on their next great eBay Inc. find. Connections between buyers
and sellers have always been at the heart of eBay Inc.'s marketplace. And now we're
using AI to make those interactions faster and easier to manage. In Q3, we rolled
out an AI assistant for member-to-member messaging across the U.S., U.K., and
Australia. This tool takes information from the listing details to provide immediate
high-quality suggested answers to buyer inquiries, enabling quicker responses.
Sellers have told us this feature has been extremely helpful in answering buyer
questions promptly, giving them more time to list items and grow their businesses
on eBay Inc. Within member-to-member messaging, we've also rolled out a fully
integrated offers experience directly into the messaging flow for customers in the
U.S., Germany, and Australia. This means buyers and sellers can now negotiate
offers, view their full offer history, and execute counteroffers without ever leaving
the conversation thread, reducing friction and driving improved sales velocity. With
each successive quarter, AI is becoming more embedded throughout the eBay Inc.
experience.

As we build on this progress, we believe AI will continue to make eBay Inc. simpler,
more personal, and more connected for every user. Moving to advertising. In Q3,
first-party advertising revenue on the eBay Inc. platform grew nearly 23%, driven by
broad-based growth across our ads portfolio. Active Promoted Listings comprised
nearly 1.2 billion of more than 2.4 billion total listings on eBay Inc., while over 4.4
million sellers adopted at least a single Promoted Listing product during the quarter.
Promoted Listings general ads were the largest contributor to year-over-year ad
revenue growth in Q3, followed by PL Priority placements, promoted off-site ads,
and promoted stores units. We continue to leverage our proprietary AI capabilities to
enhance advertising performance.
For instance, we recently launched a new multimodal embedding model on view
item pages to deliver more relevant recommendations to buyers. This model led to a
measurable uplift in promoted listings revenue, by leveraging a listing's imagery in
addition to its title and other listings details to surface higher quality
×
recommendations. In financial services, we reached a major milestone for our Seller
Capital program in Q3. Since the inception of this program in 2021, more than $1
billion in growth capital has been dispersed to eBay Inc. sellers across the U.S., U.K.,
and Germany through our financing partners, including more than $200 million
through 2025.
Many sellers have told us this additional working capital has made a significant
difference in their ability to invest in inventory, people, and technology to grow their
businesses on eBay Inc. Turning next to our shipping initiatives, which have become
a critical strategic imperative in today's increasingly complex environment for cross-
border trade. The recent elimination of the de minimis exemption for imports under
$800 has created incremental cost and friction for cross-border trade into the U.S.
To help our sellers and buyers navigate these challenges, we meaningfully
accelerated our multi-year product roadmap for shipping solutions. In October, we
launched eBay International Shipping in Canada, our third largest corridor for U.S.
imports, after Greater China and Japan.

This rollout brings the best parts of the U.S. program to both business and
consumer sellers in Canada, along with additional capabilities like delivery duties
paid functionality, and automated application of country of origin data. In Q4, we
also began enabling business sellers in Germany to access SpeedPack, an end-to-
end cross-border shipping solution offered through a joint venture, which is already
available to sellers in Greater China and Japan. SpeedPack automates customs
documentation and tariff calculations, helping sellers manage new trade
requirements with greater efficiency. By simplifying compliance and improving
delivery time predictability, SpeedPack strengthens the resilience of cross-border
trade on eBay Inc. and ensures buyers continue to receive a reliable shopping
experience with transparent duties.
As we advance our strategic initiatives, we're equally focused on fostering the
culture and talent that makes this progress possible. I'm proud that our dedication
to building an inclusive workplace environment continues to be recognized
×
externally. eBay Inc. has been named one of Forbes America's best employers for
company culture, one of Time World's best companies, and one of Newsweek
America's greatest companies for 2025. These acknowledgments reaffirm our
efforts to foster a positive, high-performing culture that attracts and retains some of
the best talent in the industry. In closing, Q3 was another strong quarter for eBay
Inc., underscoring the momentum in our strategy and the resilience of our
marketplace.
Our focus categories continue to drive significant growth for our overall
marketplace, driven by continued innovation, trusted experiences, and increased
selection for enthusiasts worldwide. Our agentic commerce platform opens up
entirely new opportunities for eBay Inc. by enabling connectivity between on eBay
Inc. and third-party agents to facilitate personalized, conversational shopping
experiences that bring eBay Inc.'s unique inventory and trust to wherever buyers
begin their search. AI also continues to make selling on eBay Inc. more seamless
and efficient, from our magical listing technology to our new member-to-member
messaging tools, that help sellers manage buyer inquiries in real-time.

I'm incredibly excited about our expansion of eBay Live into new Europe, which
builds upon the tremendous momentum we're seeing in the U.S. as we bring live,
community-driven commerce to more enthusiasts. Lastly, our investments in global
shipping services are not only helping us support sellers in the current environment
but are accelerating our roadmap to make cross-border trade more frictionless,
which can drive more velocity for consumers and small businesses around the
world. Together, these investments keep eBay Inc. well-positioned for continued
long-term sustainable growth as we reinvent the future of e-commerce for
enthusiasts. With that, I'll turn the call over to Peggy, who will provide more details
on our financial performance and outlook. Peggy, over to you.
Peggy Alford: Thank you, Jamie. I will begin with the financial highlights of the third
quarter. GMV grew 8% to $20.1 billion. Revenue grew over 8% to $2.82 billion. Our
non-GAAP operating income grew 9% year over year to $764 million. Non-GAAP
earnings per share grew over 14% year over year to $1.36, and we returned
×
approximately $760 million to shareholders through repurchases and cash
dividends. Let's take a closer look at our financial and operating metrics for the third
quarter. GMV grew 8% to $20.1 billion on an FX neutral basis, accelerating by
roughly four points sequentially.
Our growth in Q3 was primarily attributable to our focus categories and overall
strength in the U.S. market, partially offset by a relatively more challenging macro
environment and changes to U.S. trade policy, including the elimination of de
minimis exemption globally in late August. Foreign exchange provided a tailwind of
approximately 180 basis points to spot GMV growth. Focus categories grew over
15% in Q3, with all focus categories contributing to our total growth from
collectibles to P&A, luxury, refurbished, apparel, and sneakers. In our U.S. market,
GMV growth accelerated to nearly 13%, driven by broad-based strength across
categories and by increases in both sold items and average selling price.
In addition to overall strength in the U.S. market, our GMV growth continued to
benefit from tailwinds like our Klarna partnership and efficiency in lower funnel
marketing spend. Because GMV is reported based on the location of the seller, the

delta between U.S. and international GMV growth was also influenced by demand
shifting toward domestic sellers due to tariffs. International GMV grew nearly 4% on
an FX neutral basis, with foreign exchange providing a tailwind of 350 basis points
to spot growth. Despite facing relatively more challenging macroeconomic
conditions outside of the U.S. in Q3, our international GMV growth also improved
sequentially.
Recent enhancements to our C2C value proposition in the UK contributed to an
overall acceleration in UK volume growth. Our cross-border business was resilient in
the third quarter. However, we saw a deceleration in year-over-year volume growth
starting in September in key markets importing into the U.S. after the removal of the
de minimis exemption. Shifting to our biometrics, our trailing twelve-month active
buyers were over 134 million, up 1% year over year. Enthusiast buyers remained
stable at roughly 16 million, while spend per enthusiast buyer grew year over year to
over $3,200 on a trailing twelve-month basis.
×
Moving on to our income statement, revenue grew over 8% to $2.82 billion on an FX
neutral basis in Q3, while foreign exchange was a tailwind of over 120 basis points
to spot growth. Our take rate was 14% in Q3 as continued strength in advertising
was partially offset by several headwinds. As sellers and buyers adjust to the new
trade policies, we are seeing an uptick in returned and canceled orders, which led to
a roughly 10 basis point headwind to our Q3 take rate as these transactions are
included in GMV, but not revenue. Our average selling price was also increased in
recent quarters, mostly driven by category mix shift, which also pressured our take
rate.
In addition, UK C2C represented a modest year-over-year headwind as we continued
to scale our managed shipping initiative during Q3. Lastly, foreign exchange was a
headwind of nearly 10 basis points to our take rate year over year. Total advertising
revenue was $525 million, representing GMV penetration of 2.6%. Within the eBay
Inc. platform, first-party ads grew nearly 23% to $496 million. We continue to
deprecate legacy third-party display ads, which declined by 40% to $7 million. Off-
platform ads grew 32%, reaching $22 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 71.6%

declined by over 80 basis points year over year due to expected headwinds from
managed shipping, traffic acquisition costs related to promoted off-site ads,
depreciation expenses, and foreign exchange.
These factors were partially offset by tax-related tailwinds as we lapped one-time
expenses a year ago and continued cost of payment efficiencies in the quarter. Our
non-GAAP operating margin was 27.1%, down 10 basis points year over year,
including a foreign exchange headwind of 10 basis points. Marketing and operating
efficiencies generated leverage in the quarter, which was partially offset by product
development expenses. As we noted last quarter, given the recent strength in our
business, we are reinvesting a portion of top-line upside in order to accelerate our
strategic initiatives, including eBay Live, shipping solutions, and vehicles.
We are also expanding our global employee footprint in order to optimize our
location strategy and to comply with U.S. data transfer policies. Non-GAAP earnings

per share was $1.36, up over 14% year over year, and GAAP earnings per share from
continuing operations was $1.28, down 1% year over year as we lapped investment
gains from last year. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation, we
generated free cash flow of $803 million in Q3 and ended the quarter with cash and
non-equity investments of $5.3 billion and gross debt of $6.8 billion on our balance
sheet. Our equity investments were valued at over $900 million.
We repurchased $625 million of eBay Inc. shares in Q3 at an average price of nearly
$88 and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $132 million in September, or $0.29 per
share. Moving on to our outlook, for the fourth quarter, we expect GMV between
$20.5 and $20.9 billion, representing FX neutral growth between 4-6% year over year.
Based on current exchange rates, we estimate FX would represent roughly 180
basis points of tailwind to spot GMV growth. Our guidance reflects a continuation of
the durable growth trends we've observed in recent quarters, driven by our
momentum in focus categories and other strategic initiatives.
Additionally, as commodity prices for precious metals have appreciated in recent
months, we have observed a notable acceleration in demand for bullion and collect

coins on eBay Inc., which may be a less durable trend. Our acquisition of Ties is also
expected to contribute roughly 10 basis points to total FX neutral GMV growth in Q4.
These tailwinds are expected to be offset by a few lapping dynamics. In Q4 of last
year, we observed exceptional GMV growth in trading cards due to a strong release
calendar. We also saw a double-digit improvement in UK C2C volume growth and
better-than-expected holiday season demand overall.
This year, we will also face a full quarter of impact from the removal of global de
minimis exemption, versus a single month of impact in Q3. We expect the net of
these headwinds to lead to a modest deceleration in GMV growth during Q4. We
forecast revenue to be between $2.83 and $2.89 billion, implying FX neutral growth
of 8% to 10% year over year. Based on current exchange rates, we estimate FX
would represent roughly 190 basis points of tailwind to spot revenue growth. Our
guidance implies year-over-year take rate expansion primarily due to our
remonetization of UK C2C volume and first-party advertising growth, partially offset
×
by mix shift and headwinds related to trade policy.
As I noted for GMV, we expect a full quarter impact from the de minimis change to
apply incremental pressure on our core take rate, advertising, and financial services
monetization. On a sequential basis, take rate is expected to be modestly lower due
to these factors as well as normal Q4 seasonality attributable to category and ASP
mix over the holidays. We expect non-GAAP operating margin between 25.8-26.3%
in Q4, representing non-GAAP operating income growth between 5-9% as reported.
The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily due to continued
investment in our strategic initiatives as we reinvest a portion of our top-line
strength in order to drive medium- to long-term growth.
We forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.31 and $1.36, representing
year-over-year growth between 5-9%. We expect net interest income to become a
headwind to year-over-year earnings growth in Q4 given prevailing interest rates and
our lower cash balance. We forecast capital expenditure to be between 4-5% of
revenue for the full year, and our non-GAAP tax rate to remain stable at 16.5%. We
expect reported free cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion for this year, including a
https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/10/29/ebay-ebay-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/ 18/36



## Page 19

18/12/2025 12:37 eBay (EBAY) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | The Motley Fool
headwind of $935 million from the unique tax items we paid this past Q2. On a
normalized basis, free cash flow is expected to be roughly $2.5 billion for 2025.
Lastly, we continue to plan on repurchasing approximately $2.5 billion of our shares
for the full year. In addition, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29
per share for the fourth quarter to be paid in December. Next, I'll share a few
preliminary thoughts on 2026. We are planning our business around the third
consecutive year of positive FX neutral GMV and revenue growth, reflecting our
confidence in our initiatives and a continuation of the strong underlying momentum
from this year. However, we are also mindful of several notable lapping dynamics in
2026. These include exceptionally high growth in trading cards, and more recently in
bullion and coins, and unexpectedly strong marketing efficiency.
In aggregate, we estimate these factors could represent a lapping consideration of
approximately two points of GMV growth for the full year in 2026. In addition, we
×
expect to face incremental headwinds from annualizing breakage associated with
the global de minimis changes. If the current level of impact remains stable
throughout 2026, it would result in a headwind to FX neutral GMV growth of
approximately one point.
We expect the gap between GMV and revenue growth to be relatively narrow in 2026
as continued healthy growth in first-party advertising revenue is expected to be
partially offset by pressure on cross-border sellers and a higher mix of GMV from
emerging businesses like vehicles and eBay Live next year, which have lower
average take rates. With regards to profitability, as we finalize our planning
decisions, we'll maintain our focus on targeting the optimal combination of GMV
growth and operating margin to maximize operating income dollar growth over the
medium to long term. We expect to face a few modest headwinds in 2026 below the
operating income line.
Our lower cash balance and the expected slope of interest rates would pressure our
net interest income year over year. And we are reevaluating our non-GAAP tax rate in
2026 and beyond, which may result in a modest increase partially due to U.S. tax
https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/10/29/ebay-ebay-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/ 19/36

dynamics. Finally, a few observations on capital allocation. We expect to return
approximately $3 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and
cash dividends in 2025, which would amount to over $12 billion of capital returns to
shareholders from 2022 to 2025. Over the last few years, we were pleased to
monetize several equity investments at attractive valuations, including Ataventa,
Adyen, and Gmarket.
These asset sales enabled us to return significantly more capital to shareholders
than our normalized free cash flow. Going forward, our framework for capital
allocation has not changed. Our priority remains organic investment in the business
to drive sustainable growth, and we will continue to evaluate inorganic opportunities
to accelerate our roadmap. With regard to excess capital, we will continue to lean
into returns to shareholders. Given our remaining investment portfolio, we do expect
that free cash flow from our core business will be the primary source for capital
returns in 2026 and beyond.
×
In a normal year, we plan to target repurchases and cash dividends totaling between
90% to 100% of normalized free cash flow, absent organic or inorganic needs for
that capital. In closing, we believe our strong Q3 results and Q4 guidance reflect the
momentum we are seeing in our business. Our strategy is working, and we believe
much of our growth is sustainable. We are taking advantage of the strength in our
business this year and making incremental investments in focus categories, C2C,
eBay Live, shipping, vehicles, Gen AI, and other areas, which will help drive balanced
top-line and bottom-line growth over the medium to long term. With that, Jamie and

question will come from Scott DeVitt with Wedbush Securities. Please unmute and
ask your question.
Scott DeVitt: Thanks for taking my question. Been impressive to see the business
growing at the rate that it is again. And, you know, we're kind of entering this new
moment in time and I just wanted to zoom out, you know, for a minute. When you
look back on the history of the Internet, Google search, and then the transition to
mobile were significant developments that caused seismic change. And so we're
kind of here again with AI. You talked, you know, a bit about some of the features
and functionality that you're integrating into the platform and how you're, you know,
attempting to use ChatGPT and otherwise.
I'm just curious as you plan for the changes that AI is going to bring to the business,
what you think are the two, three, four most significant changes that you're
anticipating in the way that eBay Inc. is going to be connecting with buyers and
×
sellers as well as the approach to advertising in coming years.
Jamie Iannone: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Scott. So, look, I think in a number of
ways. I mean, I think one of the biggest opportunities for us being really focused on
non-new in-season and used supply is to really be that unlocker of supply for
consumers across the world. And so when you think about what's sitting in garages,
closets, you know, people's houses, the ability to leverage AI to make that almost
instantaneous to list is a vision of ours that we've been progressing towards with
magical listing and it is going well.
What I hear from consumers is, "Oh my God, if it's that easy to list, I have so much
stuff that I could sell on the platform." So that's a big opportunity for us. The second
is how it's transforming how people shop, and the level of discovery that we can
give them on the platform. When I look at what we're doing now with having so
much rich data of thirty years of data, what's happening with our consumers in the
marketplace, being able to leverage that in a way that really kind of delights the user
and gives them an ideal experience, I think is another benefit.

## Page 22

18/12/2025 12:37 eBay (EBAY) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | The Motley Fool
How it changes recommendations, how it changes search, how it changes
discovery on the platform, is probably the second area that I'm most excited by. And
then the last one I would say is really kind of the pace of innovation of the company,
you know, leveraging AI. And you're seeing that, you know, this quarter as we
announced a new visual camera intelligence with Apple in the camera phone. As we
bring new capabilities to save sellers time like in our member-to-member
messaging that we're launching here. The work that we're doing in our own
shopping assistant, we have a screenshot of some of that type of stuff that you're
seeing in the slides that we put together.
Giving more relevant recommendations to our buyers on the view item pages. You
talked about advertising. Even what we announced this quarter where we're taking a
multimodal approach to our advertising performance, provides more high-quality
recommendations. So, I'd say, every quarter, AI is becoming more embedded
throughout our experience. I feel, you know, privileged to be in a situation where
×
we've got a technology infrastructure that really blends a hybrid cloud infrastructure,
our own LLMs that we've been building on, agentic protocols, and thirty years of
data, that all together to kind of bring those simpler, more seamless, and more
magical experiences to life for customers.
Scott DeVitt: Thanks, Jamie.
Leila: Your next question will come from Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein Research.
Nikhil Devnani: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about
margins. You've had really strong growth this quarter and again in the guide. But it
doesn't seem to be flowing through the margin upside to the same degree. So could
you please elaborate on where some of the incremental investments are right now?
It's noticeable that product development has been ramping for the last couple of
quarters. Should we be looking at this as a pull forward of certain fixed costs that
would otherwise have happened in 2026? Because you can now? Or are there also
other more variable and persistent expenses that we need to take into account as
we think about margins next year? Thank you.
https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/10/29/ebay-ebay-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/ 22/36



## Page 23

18/12/2025 12:37 eBay (EBAY) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | The Motley Fool
Peggy Alford: Sure. Thank you for the question. So when we think about margins,
we're really trying to balance driving long-term growth and then returning flowing
through upside to the bottom line. I'm very pleased with the 9% operating profit
growth that we achieved in Q3 and this momentum that we continue to see in the
business. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 27.1% and that included an FX
headwind of 10 basis points and we did generate operating leverage in the quarter.
In terms of some of the expense lines, sales and marketing expense was up 2% year
over year and flat quarter over quarter. And this was due to marketing efficiencies.
Product development expenses that you mentioned, we actually did take some of
the upside and we were investing in product development against some of our very
strategic initiatives, including eBay Live, our shipping solutions where we pull
forward our CBT roadmap to really help sellers navigate the changes in the trade
policies. And then really looking at more investment in our vehicles business as
well. And we believe this strategy is working and will primarily benefit our growth
×
next year and beyond. Our G&A expenses were up about 4% year over year and
down 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue, and this was driven by lower
employee-related spend. And then lastly, transaction losses were up 19%.
A lot of it had to do with our higher consumer protection losses that were due to the
ramp of the UK managed shipping program as well as some unfavorable
fluctuations in buyer and seller fraud. This is an area that fluctuates quarter by
quarter, but nothing really concerning in the trends. So overall, we will continue to
focus on ensuring that we're balancing top-line growth and margin flow through and
trying to really get this balance right as we think about it going forward.
Nikhil Devnani: Thanks, Peggy. If I could just follow-up there. Does some of the
investment this year ease the burden on next year? Or is there just a long list of
things you want to go after as you think about the product roadmap?
Peggy Alford: We will continue to invest in our priority areas as we look into Q4 and
next year. We're pretty early in the planning cycle, and so we'll definitely provide
more commentary as we get more information about how we want to invest in
https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/10/29/ebay-ebay-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/ 23/36



## Page 24

18/12/2025 12:37 eBay (EBAY) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | The Motley Fool
getting that balance right between top line and bottom line. But you can be assured
that's what we'll be focused on.
Nikhil Devnani: Thank you.
Leila: Your next question will come from Nathaniel Jay Feather with Morgan Stanley.
Nathaniel Jay Feather: Hey, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. And
really impressive growth this quarter. I guess just two on my end. First, given how
quickly the marketplace has accelerated, you know, how are you thinking about the
portions that might be more temporary to this year and the portions that are more
durable for 2026? And then looking forward to next year, what are the key kind of
one or two that you think could be the most incremental to continue the sustained
improvement? Thank you.
Jamie Iannone: Yeah. So, good to hear from you, Nathaniel. So look, I think the ×
strength that we see was really broad-based in Q3, both in our focus categories and
our core categories. And it's really, for us, the culmination of years of investment
and that's helped us fuel consistent market share gains. When we look at the first
half of this year, we think we picked up two points of segment share gains in our
focus categories. And you saw the strength across, you know, core and across our
focus categories. In terms of the durability, you know, we did see some GMV upside
from what we would characterize as transitory factors, which we discussed in our
prepared remarks.
But we do believe the majority of our growth was durable in nature. And overall,
confident our strategy is working and we're leaning in towards a path of sustainable
growth. You know, and as we think about growth vectors, I think it's, you know, a
continuation of the areas that you've seen. The acceleration that we're seeing in
focus categories, you know, we've added fashion as our newest focus category, and
we're seeing continued momentum there. We're going to continue to invest in the
horizontal areas that we've been going after across selling, search, leveraging AI,
new discovering experiences, which we think will help focus categories and core
categories.

And we're excited about some of our newest areas of growth, particularly, you know,
eBay Live. I talked about, you know, the growth we're seeing, which is, you know, a
five times greater run rate than we saw a year ago. And we're just launching some
new geographies there in the UK and Germany. As well as our vehicles business.
You know, we're in the early phase of growth there. But the early customer
satisfaction and feedback from our sellers and buyers is that the new secure
checkout proposition is really resonating with them.
And, you know, we're seeing great activity and purchases, you know, multistate
purchases, that are now leveraging our financing, our insurance, our warranty, our
transportation title verification, that end-to-end process, which is pretty exciting. So,
those are the growth factors that I would point out to you.
Nathaniel Jay Feather: Great. Thank you.
×
Leila: Your next question will come from Deepak Mathivanan with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Deepak Mathivanan: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Jamie, maybe I'll ask a
couple of questions for you. So first, how do you how are you currently strategically
approaching partnerships with, you know, AI assistants and agents? Obviously, it
seems like a lot of things are happening fast in e-commerce on the agent side. Are
there any technical constraints or any other things that you would call out as
potential constraints for you?
And then second question, you know, staying on the AI topic, how should we think
about the areas where you would be deploying the advancements that just that we
are seeing with, you know, LLMs and other AI tools in 2026 into the eBay Inc.
platform to improve the buyer experience? Anything you can share there would be
great.
Jamie Iannone: Yeah. Great. Thanks for the questions, Deepak. So, you know, look.
On the on the working with agentic partners, like we've seen on the selling side,
where it's really helped us improve our experience, we're excited that our early work
for buyers with agentic shopping and discovery really opens up new ways to explore
https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/10/29/ebay-ebay-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/ 25/36

eBay Inc.'s inventory. So, you know, for now, for more than a year, we've been testing
a variety of agentic experiences to learn how buyers and sellers engage at different
phases of the journey. We've called that our AI shopping assistant. That's been live
and making improvements month after month to, you know, to really kind of fine-
tune the experience there.
And that's all led us to build what we call the unified agentic commerce platform.
Think about that as, you know, taking our hybrid cloud infrastructure, the LLM
ecosystem that we've built, including these models that we've been fine-tuning over
time, along with our MCP servers and driving that, leveraging the LLMs that we built,
these agentic protocols, combining, you know, eBay Inc.'s thirty years of data and
our rich history of what's happening with our customers.
That now puts us, and this is more to your second question, Deepak, that now puts
us more in a really enviable position from a technology standpoint to experiment
×
and innovate and really leverage the insights that we've had and that we've gained
by doing that work. You know, when I think about, you know, eBay Inc. as it relates
to, you know, agentic commerce, clearly, we're working on bringing agentic
commerce to our buyers on the platform, allowing them to search via natural
language searches, etcetera. You'll see an example of that in the slides that we put
forth together if you're not in that test case.
Of how we're using that to give them more variability and discovery opportunities as
well. But as we think about our inventory, we think we've got really unique inventory
because we're focused on non-new in-season and used and refurbished, you know,
across both C2C and B2C sellers and have 2.4 billion listings. Secondarily, when you
think about eBay Inc.'s inventory, it's generally more what I would say is a considered
purchase rather than, you know, a commodity type of thing that you're just kind of
refilling. And the third is that our focus category strategy over the last couple of
years has really allowed us to apply services and value around the transaction.
Think about Authenticity Guarantee, guaranteed fit, warranties on refurbish, you
know, one-click grading, what we're doing in international, etcetera. So all of those, I
https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/10/29/ebay-ebay-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/ 26/36



## Page 27

think, you know, gives us the experience of a really unique set of inventory, which is
why we fine-tune and train our LLMs to be able to search and discover that inventory
and collect all those into an MCP server that really leverages that data and insights.
So overall, we're going to continue to do the type of thing that we showed in the
slides there, which is allow agentic technologies to be used on the platform to
discover inventory, to improve how our sellers surface inventory on the platform.
To improve how recommendations show up on the platform by leveraging AI
agentic technologies. And we also now have the technology we can really have this
collaboration between third-party agents and first-party agents on our own platform.
Leila: Our next question will come from Shweta Khajuria with Wolfe Research.
Please unmute and ask your question.
Andrew Boone: Hi, this is Andrew up for Shweta. Thanks for taking the question.
×
Wanna focus a little bit on trading cards. How should we think about the
sustainability of growth within the category and, you know, what type of signals or
metrics could we use to kind of evaluate the success of the category? Thanks.
Jamie Iannone: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Andrew. Look. As it relates to trading
cards, we see a long runway of growth for trading cards. We believe most of the
recent growth has been driven by the trust and the innovation that we've driven for
hobbyists over the last several years. Think about all the things we've introduced,
Andrew, like My Collection, magical listings, bulk listing capabilities, our partnership
with PSA on grading and authentication, and on vault storage. So, I've always said
that our trading card business is not linear.
It's going to ebb and flow based on the popularity of whether it's new releases or
collaborations or new rookie classes or chase cards, you know, and we won't always
be firing on all cylinders like we are now with, you know, all the sports leagues, NFL,
NBA, MLB, as well as Pokemon and Magic. Really having strong years. But what we
see today is really a healthy balance between new buyers, sold items, and ASP
contributing to that growth. And that's what gives us the confidence and the

durability of our GMV run rate moving forward. Even if the year-over-year growth
decelerates in the coming quarters.
Leila: Your next question will come from Michael Morton with MoffettNathanson.
Michael, you may now unmute your line and ask your question.
Michael Morton: Hey, sorry about that. Thanks for the question. One big picture one
and then maybe one more near-term financial. When we look at the strategy that you
deployed with the trading cards, what seems to be really successful was the ability
to reduce friction. We don't need to, like, walk through all the steps, but we know
how that played out through the business. And a question we get a lot from
investors recently is how big can your vehicles business be? And, like, when we look
at what Carmel does and what you've done with prior focus categories, it was pretty
effective and it's obvious that cars come at high ASPs. And it's going to be booked
as GMV.
×
So how should we think about this flowing through the model over the next year and
any implications for take rates that could move one way or another we might not
have thought through. And then just a near-term one, I think you rolled out halo
attribution in the U.S. and, like, other North American markets starting in 2026, and I
think you had a lot of success with that in other countries around the ad product. So
wondering what the expectations are there to drive ads and the take rate. Thank you
so much.
Jamie Iannone: Yeah. Look. You're right on the, you know, vehicles experience. It
really is about making it a seamless experience end-to-end, like we've done in
trading cards and in other categories. And what we saw in Carmel was really this for
sellers and buyers where we handle everything for them. So identity, title verification,
the transfer of ownership, payments, financing, insurance, warranty, and
transportation because a lot of these cars go across state lines, for example. So,
where we're focused is really in the collectible car market, which is about a $75
billion addressable market of the $1 trillion plus used car market that's out there.
You know, we're excited by it because, a) it's really resonating with customers.

We're seeing, you know, great activity that's really leveraging this end-to-end. So, we
just had a 2015 Rolls Royce Ghost sold for $113,000, and it uses our secure
purchase. Our DMV services actually use our buyer financing, etcetera. Ranging all
the way to a school bus from 2008 that was converted into an RV sold for $31,000
for a seller in California and a buyer in Missouri. And again, using that full end-to-end
suite of services. It kind of speaks to the opportunity that we have in vehicles. I think
the other reason we're excited by it is because of the synergies and overlap we see
with our parts and accessories business.
You know, since we are going after this collectible car market, it's really congruent
with those that want to restore, fix up older and collectible cars and it tends to be
enthusiasts that are into parts and accessories are also really into these collectible
vehicles. So we think there's really nice synergies from both the buyer and the seller
base there. Peggy, maybe you want to touch a little bit on the higher ASP of vehicles
and the impact of that on take rate?
×
Peggy Alford: Sure. Absolutely. So we're really excited about this long-term
opportunity in vehicles. And what secure purchase unlocks. Vehicle volume has
seen significant growth quarter over quarter since we launched earlier this year. But
the contribution to total volume is still very modest as we expected. We estimate
that Carmel's effective take rate will fall to the low to mid-single-digit range when
including both the buy-side and the sell-side monetization. But the revenue
contribution also so far this year has been immaterial. And so I don't expect that it
would have any material impact on your models for the rest of this year or next year.
Jamie Iannone: On the ads attribution change, we think that the new halo attribution
better aligns the value of our CPA ads with the velocity that we provide to sellers. I
think it helps better calibrate the return on ad spend levels between CPA and CPC.
You're right, Michael. This is something that we released back in Germany in
February, expanded in the June timeframe to other key markets across the European
region, and then we announced today we plan to roll that to the U.S. and Canada in
the new year. And this was really based on the learnings that we saw from other
markets.
https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/10/29/ebay-ebay-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/ 29/36

Where, you know, those learnings said that, you know, what we saw from sellers was
they can certainly adjust and adopt their bids as a result of these changes. But the
net effect of the attribution change was positive for our ads monetization in
Germany. And importantly, we're very focused on the ROAS levels for our sellers.
And our ROAS levels remain healthy for our sellers and they continue to adopt our
CPA ads. So, that's why we've extended it now to the U.S. and Canadian markets.
Leila: Your next question will come from Thomas Steven Champion with Piper
Sandler.
Thomas Steven Champion: Hi, good afternoon. Jamie, it looks like engaged buyers
spend increased and your listings count has made tremendous progress over the
last couple of years. I think it was 2.4 billion this quarter. And I guess the question is
when do you think this better inventory and maybe personalization features
translate into more active buyers and enthusiast buyers? I'd be curious about your
×
view on that. And then maybe just any update for us on the Facebook marketplace
partnership. Thank you.
Jamie Iannone: Yeah. Look. On the buyer side, our trailing twelve-month active
buyers grew by 1% to 134 million in Q3. As you say, top of the funnel is important for
us. But we are very focused on driving active buyers to become enthusiast buyers.
And what we're seeing there is that we've seen consistent, albeit gradual
improvements in our year-over-year growth rate for enthusiasts over the past three
years. We've seen GMV per enthusiast buyer grow. In Q3, it was over $3,200
annually. And continued to grow year over year.
And what we also see is despite the fact that we're in a challenging environment,
macro environment in Europe, and that's part of our buyer growth, we really don't
see our enthusiast buyers churn on the marketplace. If anything, because of the
macro, they may move to mid values. But our mid-value buyers, which is the cohort
just below enthusiasts, have been growing year over year every quarter since the
beginning of 2024. So we're continuing to invest in full-funnel marketing across the
board. We think that, obviously, that has a longer payback for buyers than just pure
https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/10/29/ebay-ebay-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/ 30/36



## Page 31

18/12/2025 12:37 eBay (EBAY) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | The Motley Fool
kind of lower funnel spend. But we think it's the right mix of marketing that we're
doing across the board.
As it relates to Facebook Marketplace, we continue to be optimistic about the long-
term potential of our partnership there. Both companies are working together to
optimize the experience and during Q3, we continued to scale that test and improve
the integrated checkout experience, which was important for us to kind of get that
right. And we believe it's great for our seller community because as we expose their
listings to face a scaled audience, that's great for Facebook Marketplace users as
they discover the breadth and, obviously, great for our sellers on the platform. So
going to continue to scale that test and work on every piece of the funnel.
Every time we worked on it, we've seen pretty significant and great improvements,
which has been great to see.
×
Leila: Your next question will come from Andrew Boone with Citizens. Thanks so
much for taking questions. I wanted to ask about one of the pieces you gave for
2026 in terms of the narrowing of revenue and GMV, and it sounds like some
pressure on advertising. Can you guys just unpack that and help us understand kind
of what exactly that means? And then Magical Listings has really made the seller
process easier. Can you guys just help us understand how that manifests back in
the GMV? What happens on the sell side as you guys do get that long-tailed listings?
How do you guys really optimize that?
Jamie Iannone: Yeah. So let me start with the magical listings point, and then we'll
talk a little bit about the advertising of the pieces. So what we see with Magical
Listings is really kind of an unlock of more inventory when sellers are starting to use
it. So, it helps them spend less time creating listings, and more time growing their
business. So over 10 million sellers have used our Magical Listings tool. I think
we're up to over 300 million items have been augmented leveraging AI. And so, it's
really about driving more velocity in selling and driving our overall CSAT experience
in selling.

## Page 32

18/12/2025 12:37 eBay (EBAY) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | The Motley Fool
Think about that as listing completion rates, you know, listings per list, or etcetera,
which all help us perform really well. We're not just focused on the listing
experience, right? As we're helping them create better pictures to help them sell
more. We're actually using AI to figure out if you're putting a promoted off-site
together, how do we which pictures do we use and how to alter all of that to kind of
help you drive sell-through, etcetera. And, you know, what's great about eBay Inc. is
having a large base of C2C sellers, and they're bringing really unique items onto the
platform.
And so if you look at the average household, we think they have three to $4,000 of
items that could be on eBay Inc., and less than 20% of that is on eBay Inc. today. It's
really about unlocking all of that inventory by making it so easy with Magical
Listings. I think on advertising, the comments we're making were more about Q4
versus Q3, where we saw strong ad growth in Q3, due to our strong volume growth
and ads adoption and we expect our 1P ads to normalize to the low to mid-teens
×
growth in Q4, was the comment that we're making about advertising.
But when you look at the ROAS that we're providing to sellers, when you look at the
experience that we're providing, we feel really good about the trajectory of our
advertising portfolio and opportunities.
Peggy Alford: And then, Andrew, in terms of your question around the narrowing of
GMV versus revenue that we commented on in 2026. We do expect the gap between
GMV and revenue growth to be relatively narrow in 2026. And this is driven from our
continued healthy growth in first-party advertising. Which is partially offset by two
things. One, fewer imports into the U.S. by CBT sellers, which slightly pressures our
advertising and financial services monetization. And then we are seeing we expect
to see a higher mix of GMV from our emerging businesses like vehicles and eBay
Live that have a lower average take rate. So that's what's driving that. Thank you.
Jamie Iannone: Operator, could we do one last question, please?
Leila: Yes. Your final question will come from Ygal Arounian with Citi.

Ygal Arounian: Hey. Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in. I guess just to look at the
2026 guidance. Maybe a little bit more closely and you know, the commentary on
positive GMV growth and you know, Peggy, you gave the kind of three points of
headwind impact. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on what positive means
and kind of where you feel like you fall in that trajectory, you know, spent, you know,
the better part of an hour talking about a lot of the improvements you guys have
made. You know, Jamie, you've called a lot of the growth durable. So I think just
helping investors kind of feel for Frameware we land in that positive.
I know it's early, on the de minimis impacts, you know, clearly, that has gotten bigger.
Any way to frame in a little bit more detail what you're seeing there? Thanks.
Peggy Alford: Sure. So we are early in our planning process, which is why we sort of
provided only high-level remarks on our preliminary commentary for next year. We
have the holiday ahead of us, and so it would be premature to talk too much about
×
how we're thinking about it specifically. We do expect our strategic initiatives to
remain the core driver of our growth, namely as we've talked about focused
categories, geographic initiatives, horizontal innovation. We're super excited about
what we know eBay Live in vehicles. Will contribute given the incremental
investments and focus that we had this year. We've pointed out some of the lapping
dynamics that we're expecting.
Some of those are, as you were asking, related to tariff announcements, where we
do expect to see a full annualized amount from the one month we saw in Q3 and the
full quarter that we'll have in Q4. And our expectations in terms of that one point
was really annualizing a similar trend to what we're currently seeing.
Jamie Iannone: And on your question on de minimis Ygal, so we did observe
breakage related to tariffs in Q3, particularly after de minimis exemption was
removed for the rest of the world in late August. That subjected, you know, a
significant amount of imports to tariffs for the first time. And sellers in, you know,
Japan and Canada were amongst the most impacted. What we've really focused on
is supporting our customers which is why we're accelerating our product roadmap
https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/10/29/ebay-ebay-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/ 33/36

for cross-border shipping services. So we talked earlier about eBay International
shipping in Canada, that's our third largest corridor into the U.S. Really giving them a
solution similar to what we brought to U.S. sellers.
And that's launched and is performing well. More extending Speedpack, which we've
talked about for China, then we extended it to Japan. We're expanding Speedpack to
our German sellers. These tools help sellers manage the friction and the complexity
associated with the changes while providing buyers price transparency. So overall,
we feel confident our marketplace is well suited to help sellers and buyers navigate
these challenges. You know, Peggy talked about some of the lapping dynamics for
next year from that. But one of the benefits we have is, you know, our diversified
supply of domestic and cross-border inventory is an advantage in this environment.
While also our non-new in-season used and refurbished inventory help consumers
find value as well.
