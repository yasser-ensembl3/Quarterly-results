Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, FIGS, Inc.

Thanks, Tom. And good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results are built on the momentum generated during the first half of the year, delivering our highest quarterly year-over-year revenue growth over the past two years, supported by strong performance across the board. Net revenues were up 8% for the quarter, well ahead of our plan. Importantly, this success was pronounced across the core parts of our business, scrubwear, the US and our business as usual selling days. At the same time, we drove the core while executing our plan to pull back on promotions. We believe these positive trends within our foundation are a great sign of our brand health and support the sustainable growth story we see ahead.

We also executed well across the P&L in Q3. Gross margin remained healthy, approaching 70% despite the growing impact of tariff headwinds. Substantial SG&A leverage reflected both the lapping of the outsized expenses last year, but more importantly, the success of our ongoing efficiency and tariff mitigation efforts. Overall, this execution supported an impressive 900 basis point improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin to 12.4% for the period.

As we look ahead, we are seeing this positive momentum carry over to the start of Q4 and we are meaningfully increasing our outlook as a result. We now expect Q4 to be our strongest net revenue growth of the year, driving our full year estimate to approximately 7% growth. We also have increased our adjusted EBITDA margin expectation above the high end of our original outlook and back to low-double-digit levels. This reflects the great progress we have made during the year despite the onset of tariff headwinds. Overall, we are executing exceptionally well against our expectations in driving better consistency. And I'm so proud of our team's collective effort as we look to deliver to all of our stakeholders, most importantly, our healthcare professionals.

Reflecting on our year-to-date results, we have seen an outstanding response to our brand and wanted to spend some time on this call walking through some of the dynamics we see contributing to our top line outperformance. At the highest level, it really comes down to our success in delivering a great product assortment and impactful connections. Starting with our product strategy, we are excited about the direction we are headed in and how we are more effectively delivering our portfolio to healthcare professionals. We see four interrelated areas of focus that are both paying dividends today and setting us up for success in the future. These include improved function and fit, expanded head-to-toe solutions, strategic inventory investments and stronger calendar alignment.

We recognize the importance of function and fit. These are already hallmarks of our brand but areas to continually improve and to address the evolving needs of healthcare professionals. From a functional standpoint, we are delivering impactful and relevant new silhouettes which are resonating with new and existing customers. This focus has been key in driving our core while also demonstrating success in elevating our assortment. Function also informs fabric leadership where our category-defining FIONx fabrication remains the centerpiece of our brand.

However, we know that there are opportunities to address the full range of activities that healthcare professionals go through every day. Our FORMx fabrication debuted in Q1 for environments where comfort and stretch are paramount, and we have seen momentum build as we have methodically expanded offerings throughout the year. We also just announced our next fiber solution, FIBREx, which is set to debut in Milan at the 2026 Winter Olympics. Lightweight yet structured, soft yet durable. This fabric is designed to work in environments like for those supporting our Olympic athletes where durability is particularly important.

Looking at our FIT initiative, our efforts are already paying off with lower returns, fewer inbound comments to our customer experience team, and improved customer trust. With our obsession with function and fit coming together, we are also excited with how our enhanced product design work will elevate the entire product portfolio in 2026 and beyond.

Continuing to build the strength in our core opens the aperture for outfitting healthcare professionals from head to toe. For example, our recently introduced ArchTek compression socks demonstrate our latest commitment to category leadership as the first ever patented medical-grade compression socks in the market. Across additional areas such as outerwear, underscrubs and footwear, our team has developed a road map of how we plan to prioritize and build out these opportunities in the years ahead. With confidence and great product, we are investing appropriately. Coming off recent periods of more conservative buying plans, we have made more informed and deeper inventory investment across certain styles and colors. This action has contributed to a better flow of newness to our healthcare professionals while also supporting better overall in-stock levels.

Finally, this all ties directly to our enhanced merchandising work around calendar alignment. We have added more rigor to how and when we deliver our products and messaging, efforts that have not only enhanced productivity across launch moments, but also our ability to leverage those moments in driving demand back to the core. This work has added importance as we reset our promotional cadence this year and as we execute against a repeatable, scalable framework for consistently delivering great product. As excited as we are with our product direction, our impact would not be what it is without our unique ability to serve our community and build connections in ways that only FIGS can. We are seeing the payoff of our amazing top of funnel moments that started with some of last year's big brand splashes and have continued throughout 2025.

Looking at some of our recent successes, let's start with what was a unique opportunity heading into this year's Emmy Awards. Last call, we detailed our advocacy work in Washington, D.C. with actor, Noah Wyle, work which went viral across our community. When Noah was then nominated for best actor for The Pitt, he challenged us to make a tuxedo for the Emmys that was as comfortable as the scrubs he wears on set. We stepped up to the challenge by creating a first-of-its-kind tuxedo. With subtle details and craftsmanship, we were proud to support Noah's desire to bring the healthcare community directly to the red carpet.

As the night progressed and momentum built, we strategically aired our Where Do You Wear FIGS spot during the last commercial segment before the awards for Best Actor and Best Drama were announced. This was executed perfectly as Noah and The Pitt went on to win both of those awards coming out of the break. On stage, Noah eloquently dedicated his award to anybody who's coming on shift tonight or anyone who's coming off shift tonight. This overall moment became among the most viral in our history, with multiple best dressed nods for Noah and 175 total placements across traditional media and social, including over 30 top-tier press articles across fashion, entertainment and lifestyle outlets.

Most importantly, our actions led healthcare professionals are [ph] also (00:08:31) humans to feel seen in a way they rarely do on the world's biggest stage. Our brand work was just getting started as we continued our year-long celebration of Where Do You Wear FIGS. Following the Emmy's, we debuted our global installment of the

campaign films across Tokyo, London, Mexico City and Los Angeles, showing how medicine is a universal language. We were excited to be able to amplify our message in key countries with upper funnel support. It is also important to highlight our work supporting breast cancer awareness. It's easy to highlight the commercial success of the campaign with our F*ing Pink and Fight Club Pink Color Launch as being one of our top-performing color drops in our history. But the more important part, the harder part was showing the inspirational work of healthcare professionals, including Dr. Elisabeth Potter, a breast reconstruction surgeon from Austin, Texas.

The success of her campaign underscored how much she resonates and is at the forefront of industry conversations in the medical community. It also reinforced the type of impact that we aspire to with Dr. Potter proclaiming, you, guys, listen, we feel represented and you care about what we're going through. The success of these campaigns are further proof points of how we strike a deep, emotional chord with healthcare professionals through the stories we tell. This has always been part of the secret sauce at FIGS. But since our Olympics campaign in 2024, we've been on a run of our best top-of-funnel campaigns ever, and we're determined not to slow down. Not only are our campaigns resonating in unprecedented ways for the brand, but we are also matching this work with added sophistication in our measurement. Performance marketing tools are giving us added insight into when to lean into brand moments and how to optimize our messaging. And importantly, we still have considerable opportunities ahead as we think about leveraging unique views of healthcare professionals to better personalize their experiences.

Finally, it's important to highlight that our great execution is bolstered even further by an industry backdrop that is returning to its pillars of fundamental strength that most other apparel industries can only dream of. This includes the replenishment-driven, largely non-discretionary and seasonless nature of our scrubwear that healthcare professionals return to over and over again. It also involves a massive industry that is among the fastest growing for any sector with over 23 million US and over 100 million international healthcare professionals. To put it simply, we are serving a strong industry with professionals that need uniforms to do their jobs.

Raising the bar further in these foundational areas also helps fuel our efforts across our three emerging growth drivers, international, TEAMS and Community Hubs. We are making important investments across all three of these opportunities in 2025, and each is expected to scale in importance in the years ahead.

Starting with international, our expansion is a significant focus and one where we have a number of recent developments. With over 80% of global healthcare professionals located outside of the US and driving less than 20% of our revenues, international remains a massive opportunity. We are rapidly expanding our footprint this year, jumping from 33 countries to nearly 60 planned international markets by the end of this year. And we are driving this expansion in a disciplined way through two strategies that's either Go Broad or Go Deep. To Go Broad, we are focusing on low-touch ways to open markets, leveraging technology and regional commonalities to efficiently expand. Following 12 new Latin American markets we announced last quarter, we are on the cusp of opening 11 new markets across the Middle East and Africa region. We know that healthcare professionals globally have the same awful experience as they used to have domestically and this strategy is an easy way to begin to reshape expectations in many smaller markets, while also informing potential future investments.

With our Go Deep strategy, we're focusing on markets with more clearly defined opportunities and taking additional steps to more directly invest. For some of our more established markets like Canada, UK and Mexico, investments extend to infrastructure as we look to localize and scale. This includes adding in-market talent, brand marketing to drive awareness and logistics to drive more efficient operations and support profitable growth. This strategy also informs our approach to several new markets, including the launch of Japan in Q2. This market is trending well today and providing great early learnings with how to serve locally. We also took the same level of care as we opened South Korea in October and we are excited to announce today that we plan to debut in China.

through Tmall later this quarter. While near-term contributions of these three new markets are expected to be modest, we see the opportunity for each to be significant drivers of our long-term international growth story.

We are also actively investing in our TEAMS and Community Hub (sic) [Hubs] opportunities, solidifying each of their own foundation for meaningful growth going forward. With TEAMS, we want to both capture the legacy demand for institutional-led buying and also influence behavior with great solutions to drive this mix even higher. To power these efforts, we have added talent to both nurture our great existing partnerships and also to better cultivate new ones. We also have a focus on unlocking seamless and customizable solutions for a wider range of institutions and are excited to begin deploying updated technology this quarter.

With Community Hubs, we are excited to debut three new stores this quarter, starting with New York's Upper East Side, planned next week and then followed by planned openings in Houston and Chicago. Each of these locations will apply key learnings from our first two stores and apply updated design and merchandising elements to enhance the overall experience. We continue to see the value of having a physical presence for the brand, particularly with nearly 40% of customers coming in new to the brand. We remain confident in our disciplined approach and are well-positioned to accelerate our cadence of openings in 2026.

Before turning the call over to Sarah, I would like to reiterate how excited we are with our progress. As we have highlighted, the foundational pieces of our business are strengthening. Our community engagement has never been more impactful and we see significant opportunities to sustain momentum in 2026 and beyond.

Importantly, we will never lose our unyielding focus in support of the healthcare community. This is an intangible thing to measure, but one that defines our brand's leadership, caring, connection and authenticity. This is our non-negotiable. It's how we drive relevance and stay in power. At the same time, we're applying more discipline, talent and rigor across all the other factors that drive our business. We are positioned well to continue our momentum and amplify the brand over the long term.

With that, I'll pass it over to Sarah.

### Chief Financial Officer, FIGS, Inc.

Thanks, Trina. Our year-to-date performance highlights the growing potential of the FIGS story as we more closely align our product strategy with our unique ability to drive impact for healthcare professionals. We are particularly encouraged to drive this high level of execution in a year where we had both the planned headwind with our promotional repositioning, as well as an unplanned headwind with tariffs. And as I'll discuss, we are excited to see the progress reflected in our full year top and bottom line expectations that have moved markedly higher the past two quarters.

But first, let me start with details of our strong third quarter performance. Net revenues increased 8% year-over-year to $151.7 million ahead of our outlook of flat to up 2%. As Trina highlighted, our performance was underscored by both scrubwear growth and US growth, each reaching two-year highs as well as the extremely encouraging strength and momentum across our business as usual selling period. These indicators continue to support our successful ability in resetting our promotional strategy this year, particularly with more aggressive action planned across the back half of the year.

From a measurement standpoint, average order value increased 6% to $114, primarily driven by higher average unit retail due to product mix and a higher rate of full price sales. Active customer growth has remained consistent throughout the year at plus 4%, pushing our active customer count to a company record of nearly 2.8 million. This

Growth comes despite our promotional reset and we have seen momentum in our acquisition trends and sustained success in bringing lapsed customers back to the brand. We were also pleased to see our trailing 12 months measure for net revenues per active customer inflect positive for the first time in three years, with 2% growth in the period to a $209.

By category, scrubwear grew 8%, representing 84% of net revenues for the period. Results were ahead of plan with strength in our core products supported by impactful color stories, strategic positioning in key styles, and effective merchandising and marketing. Color launches in cadencing were successful in not only driving excitement to new offerings, but also energized our core colors. Looser-fitting silhouettes are increasingly resonating, particularly in bottom, and we are leading and investing in these areas. In complementing our great assortment, we continue to drive cohesion with how and when we deliver and message to our customers, which is driving productivity.

Non-scrubwear increased 7% representing 16% of net revenues. We saw strong growth in underscrub, which included new three quarter-length versions of our popular Salta and Makato styles, and were inspired by customer feedback. Shoes rebounded from some of the executional challenges in last year's period and were supported by strong coordination with our color stories. And we were excited to launch our ArchTek socks at the end of the quarter, which we believe will be a great core offering to address healthcare professional needs going forward. Notably, results also reflect the comping of some Olympics-driven newness in areas like outerwear and bag. But we remain excited with the pipeline of product in these key areas going forward.

By geography, US sales increased 8% to $127.3 million. This was our strongest performance over the past nine quarters and continued to reflect balanced growth across both new and repeat customers. International net revenues increased 12%, led by particular strength in driving new customers. Headline growth was solid but had some nuances that understated our overall strength. In particular, we had a more significant reduction in promo days relative to the US, which had an outsized impact on Canada and Australia. Two of our larger markets. Nonetheless, we are excited as we look at our overall performance, including active customers of strong double-digit, AOV up in all regions and ahead of the consolidated growth and fantastic business as usual growth.

Gross margin for Q3 expanded 280 basis points to 69.9%. Key contributors to this year-over-year performance included lower discounts from the reduction in promotional days, improved return rates and processing, lower duties and reduced freight costs. These tailwinds were partially offset by higher tariffs. Results were significantly better than planned, driving our best quarterly performance since early 2023 with broad-based upside, including conservative sell-through assumptions of the mix of non-tariff goods and through our improved returns processing work.

Our selling expense for Q3 was $35.8 million, representing 23.6% of net revenues compared to 27.5% last year. As a reminder, last year's third quarter included the majority of transition costs associated with the opening of our Arizona fulfillment center. In addition to lapping these costs, we drove continuous improvement here as we further optimize our business.

We also saw improvements in shipping, given our successful actions to optimize our carrier mix, improve pricing and drive strong service levels. Marketing expense for Q3 was $23.5 million, representing 15.5% of net revenues, down from 20.3% last year. The reduction in the spending rate primarily reflected lapping last year's strategic investment to outfit the Team USA Medical team at the Olympic Games and efficiency in marketing spend.

G&A for Q3 was $37.1 million, representing 24.5% of net revenues compared to 25.3% last year. Consistent with prior quarters, the lower G&A expense rate was primarily due to a meaningful reduction in stock-based.

### Q3 2025 Earnings Call 06-Nov-2025

- Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was $18.9 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.4% compared to 3.4% last year.
- Net income for the quarter was $8.7 million or diluted EPS of $0.05 compared to net loss of $1.7 million last year or diluted loss per share of $0.01.

- On our balance sheet, we finished the third quarter with a strong net cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment position of $241.5 million.
- Inventory increased 23% year-over-year to $151.2 million, or up 20% on a unit basis.

Several factors are impacting the buildup of inventory:
- Action to support both product introductions and deeper investments in key styles.
- Higher than planned level of in-transit inventory reflecting earlier timing due to process improvements across the supply chain.

- While the gap between unit growth and dollars growth was modest during the quarter, we expect the growing impact of tariffs will contribute to a wider spread in Q4.
- On the capital allocation side, we did not repurchase shares this period and have $52 million available for future repurchases under our current share repurchase program.
- Capital expenditures for the quarter were $2.9 million, primarily related to our three new community hubs, and we now expect approximately $7 million for the full year.

### Updated Outlook
- Full year 2025, net revenues are now expected to grow approximately 7% year-over-year ahead of our prior outlook of up low single-digit.
- Factors supporting even better implied growth in Q4:
- Momentum from the third quarter, including a successful breast cancer awareness campaign.
- Strategic investments in inventory position for better availability of key products and styles.
- Best balance of new colors and styles offered year-to-date.

- We will complete our yearlong promotional reset this quarter, though do not expect the corresponding revenue drag to be as meaningful as Q3.
- Looking at gross margins, our full year 2025 outlook has improved from our prior call and now expect only a modest year-over-year decline from last year's level of 67.6%.

### Headwinds and Offsetting Factors
- Two sizable headwinds in Q4:
- Ramping sequential tariff pressure as more impacted goods average into our product cost.
- Lapping a sizable one-time benefit from duty-drawback claims in the year ago period.

- Items helping offset these pressures:
- Lower discounts.
- Improvements in returns processing and freight.
- Better scale on certain styles in conjunction with demand.

### SG&A Outlook
- Full year SG&A story continues to show strong leverage following last year's outsized investments.
- Q4 is still expected to show some expense rate deleverage, but the magnitude has been reduced by improved top line assumptions across each of our expense buckets.
- Selling expenses should continue to benefit from scaling efforts and tariff mitigation strategies.
- Marketing expense rate is planned to meaningfully increase, reflecting both lower spend rate from the prior year.

our ramping support for the forthcoming 2026 Winter Olympics. And the G&A rate will continue to reflect lower year-over-year stock-based comp, partially offset by higher planned people costs.

Overall, we are updating our full year adjusted EBITDA margin to approximately 10.3% compared to the prior range of 8.5% to 9% and ahead of the original outlook of 9% to 9.5%. We also want to provide several high-level comments that pertain to our early 2026 planning. First, on net revenue, we are committed to growing the business in 2026, which should continue to be supported by strong current momentum and ongoing process improvement. Additionally, we expect the investments we have made in our three emerging growth drivers, International, TEAMS, and Community Hubs will begin to have more material impact. While not all of these factors will have linear contributions, we are excited to further unlock these businesses given our strengthening core.

Next on tariff mitigation. As we have discussed, we have a number of levers across both product cost and SG&A that we have already pulled and some that remain in consideration. We have already seen strong execution as we optimize cost across inbound and outbound shipping and at our fulfillment center, benefits that we plan to extend into 2026. Our supplier negotiations have been productive and are expected to yield additional savings next year. And while we do not plan to take any pricing action in 2025, it remains a lever for next year.

And finally, on margin. The bar for 2025 adjusted EBITDA margin has been raised despite an estimated unmitigated tariff drag of approximately 110 basis points. However, with an estimated annualized unmitigated impact of closer to 440 basis points, we expected the majority of tariff headwinds is still ahead of us in 2026. As such, we will use our ongoing planning process to continue monitoring the overall environment while also balancing our ongoing discipline, the full range of tariff mitigation as well as strategic investment level. While it is too early to provide specifics, we do think it is important to note that we see opportunity for 2026 adjusted EBITDA margins to be within range of current 2025 expectations.

Overall, we are energized to be in such an incredible industry where serving healthcare professionals is paramount. And with improving profitability and ample balance sheet flexibility, we believe we are positioned to remain on offense and drive the sustainable long-term growth story we see ahead.

I will now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?

#### QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION

Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Bob Drubul with BTIG. Your line is now open.

**Robert Scott Drbul**
Analyst, BTIG LLC
Hi, good afternoon and nice quarter.

**Trina Spear**
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, FIGS, Inc.
Thank you, Bob.

**Robert Scott Drbul**
Analyst, BTIG LLC
I just got a couple – welcome. Couple of questions for you. Just on the gross margin performance this quarter, I guess when you look at it a little bit longer term in the next year, but I would even say like when you look at your historical results, given your ability to sort of navigate a lot of the tariffs. Can you just talk us through how you envision that segment, that line item with the business over the next several years, I guess, at this point?

**Sarah Oughtred**
Chief Financial Officer, FIGS, Inc.
Hi, Bob. Yes, so we saw a really great gross margin for this quarter up to 69.9%. Obviously, that's been quite higher than where that rate has been. We did see some components there, some that will continue into the future, but some that are unique to the quarter. So, we are seeing improved discount rates from the pullback in our promo strategy and we'll see that continue into Q4 as being a benefit year-over-year. But longer term that increased year-over-year will moderate as that promo strategy normalizes into next year. We've been working hard with our new returns partner and seen some good improvement in our refurbishment rates. And then there was a bit of nuance in-house and returns processing happens with the prior year DC transition.

So we do expect some of those improvements in refurbishment rates to continue going forward, but not at the same rate that we saw in the quarter. And we've been really working hard to optimize our inbound rates and we saw the benefit of that this quarter and that should continue into next year until we annualize that. Obviously, tariffs are the biggest piece, and so that will have a 440 bps total impact next year or up 330 bps. And there's still some unknowns around how tariffs will remain. So, we'll continue to monitor that. But feeling good with our measures of how we're able to continue to find efficiencies within margin and carry that into future to continue to work on offsetting those tariffs.

... the demand that you saw during the business-as-usual-days when you didn't offer promotions? How was Q3 performance on those days relative to where it was in the first half? And second, given tariffs are intensifying and demand is holding up well, what do you need to see to revisit the pricing lever for next year.

----

**Sarah Oughtred**
Chief Financial Officer, FIGS, Inc.
Great. So, in terms of our business-as-usual-days, we've seen acceleration each quarter in those business-as-usual-days. So, really, great to see that. And it's really from the broad-based performance that we're seeing across both the US and International as well as both scrubwear and non-scrubwear. So, really happy with that performance and it's really that acceleration that has had revenue growth rates overall accelerate each quarter. So, really happy with what we're seeing there. And then, I think you asked on pricing. And so, our pricing remains consistent with what we've shared previously. Several considerations that we've shared before that still remain, which is healthcare professionals need our products to do the critical work that they do. Nearly two-thirds of our customers make under $100,000 a year, and we have 16 core styles that generate the majority of our revenue. So, our ability to simply flow through higher prices into new seasons or new styles is limited. We want to be prudent and there is still some open-endedness on where tariffs will land.

We've been working really hard on our tariff mitigation and these efforts include optimizing our supplier base, negotiating discounts with our suppliers and driving efficiency in inbound and outbound. The great news is that we've seen strong progress on these measures to date. We're not going to be taking pricing in 2025. And if we were to take any future pricing, that decision would be held to share with our healthcare professionals first so that we can control the narrative and deliver with the care that our healthcare professionals deserve.

Afternoon. And thank you for taking the question. Trina, Sarah I was hoping we could discuss the trends that you're seeing in AOV. Understood that some of this is coming from the promo reset, but how are you thinking about the opportunity for AOV to contribute to revenue growth as you look ahead into 2026? Similarly, can you talk a little bit about the customer trends that you're seeing? Are your customers engaging more frequently? Are

they staying for longer? Are you seeing better reactivation trends or better new acquisition trends? And are you seeing any trends specifically within any age or income cohorts given the broader macro environment? Thank you.

Sarah Oughtred
Chief Financial Officer, FIGS, Inc.
Great. I'll start with the question on AOV. So, in terms of AOV, we've been seeing that increase each quarter and saw a fairly large increase in the current quarter, up 6%, that is driven from both mix shift in our product as well as the pullback in our promotional efforts. And so, I think as we think about 2026, we still think there is some opportunity for AOV to continue to increase. And that's largely with how we're thinking about product mix and continuing to build out that full assortment, head to toe, of that healthcare professional and continue to drive into higher wallet share that we know is available to us.

Trina Spear
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, FIGS, Inc.
And I'll just add in terms of the trends we're seeing in our consumer, Brooke, as you know, we don't – we serve a different consumer than the average apparel or even e-commerce company. Our customer works in an industry that has a real, like, level of stability. People need healthcare workers. They're not going anywhere. And if anything, our industry is really accelerating. It's the – healthcare jobs are the fastest growing job segments. They're growing 3 times faster than the overall job market. And the demand for healthcare professionals is expected to remain high. And so, a lot of the trends that we've seen in the quarter, some of it is this fundamentals of the industry. And obviously, what we're doing on the product side, on the marketing side to execute at the level that you're seeing. And so, if you even – to your question around like the trends we're seeing, we're seeing our customers come back. If you look at repeat frequency and you kind of remove the impact of the promotional pullback, we're seeing repeat frequency up significantly. We're seeing our reactivations up significantly. And we're seeing actually cohorts performing across all income levels. So, really, great trends across the board and we're – and we feel really confident that the post-COVID overhang is easing and we're operating in a much more normalized environment. And it's great to see.

Hey, guys. This is probably just a follow-up from some of the earlier questions, but just wanted to hear a little bit about what's driving the acceleration that you're implying into the fourth quarter despite the tougher comparison year-over-year. Just wanted to hear you kind of talk a little bit more about the drivers of the acceleration in the end of the year here.

### 06-Nov-2025

Hey, Matt. Yeah. So, I mean, we've been seeing some really broad based and healthy trends that have continued to progress as the year has gone on and see the opportunity for that to continue into Q4. And so we feel good with how our product and marketing is set up for the fourth quarter. And we think we can get there with continuing the trends that we've seen. So, we've been seeing that new customer acquisition has turned positive in terms of growth for the last two quarters. And seeing that momentum also really come from our domestic business, which carries weight in terms of the overall growth. We're seeing some great trends in the business-as-usual-days that has been accelerating. So, all of those components has been captured in how we're thinking about the fourth quarter upcoming.

From a promotional perspective, our stance has still remained with how we had seen before. So, the improvement in revenue growth expectations from Q4 really comes from our business as usual days. So, no change in how we've been thinking about promo. And for Q4, the focus will be on Black Friday, Cyber Monday, but similar to previous quarters, there will be a pullback in our efforts versus the prior year.

Okay, helpful. Can I ask about community hubs? You guys sounded more excited, I guess, than usual about the opportunity to lean in there going into 2026. Just wanted to hear a little bit more about the potential drivers of growth with community hub and where we are with store formats and how they're set up for growth next year.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

### Trina Spear
#### Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, FIGS, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, Matt. So, we're really excited about our community hubs. We're about to more than double the amount that we have. We only have a community hub in Century City in Los Angeles today and in Philadelphia in Rittenhouse Square. And we're about to open in New York City on the Upper East Side at 69th and 3rd, this – we're right in what's called hospital row, which is incredible. So you have Memorial Sloan Kettering, you have the Hospital Special Surgery (sic) [Hospital for Special Surgery], New York-Presbyterian, Weill Cornell, Rockefeller. These are powerhouse healthcare institutions that are literally at the same intersection of where we are.

Houston, we're opening right near Texas Medical Center, the world's largest medical complex. It has 120,000 employees, 10 million patient encounters a year, over 180,000 surgeries a year. And so, Houston, incredible healthcare professional city and it's a great place to be and we're really excited.

Finally in Chicago, we're located less than 2 miles west of the Loop. We're in Illinois medical District. It's one of the largest urban medical district clusters in United States, four major hospital systems, two medical university campuses, 40-plus healthcare related facilities. And not just – those are just opening the rest of 2025. And it's November 6 today, so couldn't be more excited. We're taking our learnings from what we've seen with our first two hubs, 40% of customers are still coming in new to the brand, 30% of customers that are coming into our community hubs are becoming omni-channel customers coming back into the stores, coming back to us online. So, really strong – and we're seeing really strong incrementality in the markets that we're in.

And so, took a lot of the learnings from our two hubs, redone the format, the space, how much inventory we can get on the floor, how we're approaching our colors – color drop stories, our newness, our layering, our fit, and how we can showcase that in new and original way. And finally, customization, right? Everyone wants their scrubs embroidered with their name and their logo so they can tell the world who they are and what they do. And so, these are just being in person with our community, having them feel and touch and experience our product and our brand is – it's so amazing and so important and we're really excited.

**Matt Koranda**

All right, very exciting. I'll leave it there. Thank you.

**Trina Spear**
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, FIGS, Inc.
Thanks, Matt.

**Operator:** Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.

**Brian Nagel**

Hi. Good afternoon. Nice quarter. Congratulations.

----

**Sarah Oughtred**
Chief Financial Officer, FIGS, Inc.
Thank you.

**Brian Nagel**
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
So, I've got a couple of questions, I guess one nearer term and then one long term. So, on the nearer-term side, as we look at the sales acceleration in the business, that's particularly what's happened here in third quarter as you're telegraphing to the fourth quarter. To what extent is that sales acceleration being driven by new products – new product introductions? And then, my follow-up question I guess is longer term, a little bit longer term in nature, but as now – as we're watching the top line of FIGS start to solidify, you're seeing the sales growth. Is there any updated thinking on how the margin, particularly like the EBITDA margin profile of the business should evolve over time? Should – do we have the potential to get back to the peak operating margins?

----

**Sarah Oughtred**
Chief Financial Officer, FIGS, Inc.
Great. So, in terms of your question on, is the growth coming from new products? I mean, actually, what we're really excited to see is the majority of the growth is coming from our core products and even in our core colors. So that's a great foundation for the long-term health of our business. So, obviously, we've seen growth in some of our newer styles and in our color. And it's really showing that when we showcase some of that newness and innovation, it actually drives the halo effect to our overall core. So, really great for us to see there that we have the ability to continue that momentum, longer term, from a sales growth perspective.

In terms of EBITDA for next year, for now, we've made the commitment that our adjusted EBITDA margin rate would be within range of our guide for 2025. And so, we do have 330 bps of tariff headwind year-over-year into next year. So, we would be offsetting that in order to stay within range of this year. And so, our ability to meaningfully offset that is from improvements that we are making in the business to be more efficient, to drive into savings, while still being able to invest for the longer term. And so, we'll have some harder ability to expand margin next year just due to the tariffs. But longer term, we see the path for this foundation to continue to go forward and us for – to drive growth both top line and into bottom line.

Hi. Good afternoon, everyone, and nice to see the progress, Trina. Two things, as you think about the Olympics...

**Dana Lauren Telsey**
Analyst, Telsey Advisory Group LLC
As you think about the Olympics coming up and the marketing for the Winter Olympics, what will be the same or different than what you did for the Olympics in Paris, knowing that summer, this is winter, what do you see is the difference? One of the interesting things in the quarter is the sequential improvement the growth rate of the non-scrubs business now up high singles compared to the slight decline last quarter. What are you seeing there? What categories are resonating? Thank you.

----

**Trina Spear**
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, FIGS, Inc.
Thank you so much, Dana. So we're really excited about our continued partnership with Team USA. As you know, we're the first company ever to outfit a medical team for any country globally, and we're really proud to be able to do that again for these upcoming Winter Games in Milan-Cortina. So there's a few things that we really learned and we're going to be applying from our lessons in Paris. First one is that we're finding more ways to have an impact. We learned a lot on the ground. We've created an even better, if you can imagine, and more dedicated space at the Team USA Welcome Experience. So that's really exciting.

We have a brand new fabrication called FIBREx. It's really made for healthcare professionals in more high-impact environments like what you would be doing outside in winter and, especially, for the medical professionals supporting our athletes during the Winter Games. I do believe this fabrication is going to go well beyond that to serving healthcare professionals within hospitals and offices and clinics. And it's a really, really great, lightweight, durable fabric that is awesome. You're going to love it.

And then finally, I think we've learned a lot in terms of how to optimize our marketing spend and how to ensure that we're really balanced across the funnel. And I think you've seen that throughout this year, really taking these very strong top-of-funnel marketing campaigns that, in some ways, are breaking the Internet. And how do we bring that all the way down to our healthcare professionals that are on social or on across channels and to meet them where they are with really strong product that serves their needs and really strong messaging that resonates and really shows the best of them back to them. And I think that's what this campaign is going to do again.

And then your question on non-scrubwear, in Q2, the growth rate was negative and that was really impacted by comping over the same quarter of the prior year that had some additional non-scrubwear launches. So what we've seen with category performance for non-scrubwear is that it can vary based on promotional comparisons, the impact of the new styles in different quarters and our work to reinvent a few areas. Happy to see that we inflected positive in non-scrubwear this quarter and even still, we are comping against the stronger quarter last year from where we had Olympics. So we had strong accessories and outerwear growth from Olympics last year that doesn't annualize this year. And I would say that our non-scrubwear did perform to our plan and has outperformed the first half. We've been happy to see consistent attachment rates and really excited about the opportunity ahead for many of the categories within non-scrubwear.

**Dana Lauren Telsey**

Operator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of **Ashley Owens** with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.

**Ashley Owens**
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hi. Great. Good afternoon and congrats as well. But maybe just first to touch on international with this now being 16% of revenue of the quarter, if we kind of parse that out and think about as just shy of $100 million run rate for the business, could you just walk us through some of the next building blocks to how you're planning to scale these regions? I know regions like Japan, South Korea are still really new. China is, obviously, coming on board but would just be curious on thoughts as to if international could sustainably grow double digits for the next several quarters and how you're thinking about that long-term mix target there.

----

**Trina Spear**
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, FIGS, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, we have a two-pronged strategy, Ashley, in terms of where we Go Broad and where we Go Deep. And it's been really exciting to see that we'll be at 60 markets by the end of this year, and that's driven by our ability to leverage both technology and our understanding of each region and use the commonalities across regions to open up markets very efficiently. And so if you think about we just – in Q3, we opened up 12 new markets, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador. I won't list them all but we can – you can get that. And then in the fourth quarter, we opened up a number of countries in the Middle East and in Africa. So that's really exciting. And then to your point, how do we Go Deep, right, that's the second part of the strategy where once certain market rescale, think about Canada, Mexico, UK, Australia, we're able to really invest more in the brand and brand awareness and really localize deeply – deeper engagement with our ambassadors, with events, in-market support. And having talent on the ground in these places and so it's very exciting to continue to build out in both – in newer markets but also really Go Deep in these larger markets that have hit what I would call critical mass. And so, no matter where you live, prior to FIGS, you had this horrible experience with your uniform. And so our goal is to get some more healthcare professionals around the world and help change the game for them.

Okay. Got it. That's super helpful. And then just quickly, to follow up, maybe on the return rate improvement, if you could help us contextualize how much of the progress there benefited margins for the quarter or the magnitude of the decline you saw? And then just following up, moving down the P&L, any other quantifiable cost savings from fewer restocks and reverse logistics activity that you'd be willing to share? Thank you.

Sarah Oughtred
Chief Financial Officer, FIGS, Inc.
Yeah. So within returns, we've seen overall improvement in our return rates and that is largely attached to some of our improvements to fit. But we definitely saw an outsized benefit related to returns processing. It is quite meaningful of a bump that we saw in Q2. And so you can really see how the implied guidance for Q4 does step down both with tariffs and mix shift into non-scrubwear that seasonally happens in Q4 and not recognizing the same degree of benefit on return that we saw in Q2.

Ashley Owens
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. Got it. I'll pass it on. Thank you.

[indiscernible] (00:54:12)

Ashley Owens
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Got it. Thanks.

Operator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.

John Kernan
Analyst, TD Cowen
Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, a lot of upside to quite a few line items in Q3. And I just want to go back to the prior question on the fourth quarter guidance because it does assume quite a bit of the momentum on the margin level doesn't continue. Can you just unpack that gross margin and then maybe the selling and G&A in fourth quarter and any expectations there given how a lot of momentum coming out of Q3 on the top line and the margin profile? Just curious what's maybe changing in Q4.

Sarah Oughtred
Chief Financial Officer, FIGS, Inc.
Yeah. Certainly. So we will have quite a step-up quarter-over-quarter from Q3 into Q4 on tariff impact. So there will be quite a step-up on the incremental amount of tariffs that Q4 has to carry and that will continue to step up as we go into 2026 as a higher portion of our inventory captures the full amount of tariffs. We also have seasonality to consider so we have a much higher proportion of our business in the fourth quarter that has non-scrubwear that carries a lower margin rate. You'll kind of see that seasonal mix if you look back at the proportion of non scrubwear business in Q4. So planning similarly and that will have some drag on the quarter.

And then also just to consider from a year-over-year perspective, as you're looking at Q4, that we did have a sizable duty drawback benefit in the fourth quarter last year. That was onetime catch-up. As we won't – that will have a headwind into year-over-year growth in Q4 as well.

And then I think you're asking in terms of the overall P&L profile, I mean as we think about our selling costs, we continue to see improvement there each quarter and happy with our efforts there and that will continue into Q4. So a lot of really great work that's been done to negotiate with our vendors, bring on multi-carriers and, at the same time, being able to provide even better service. And so that will continue into Q4. From a marketing perspective, the marketing rate will increase in Q4 from what you see in each quarter in 2025. And that's a function of us starting our investments to support the Olympics, which happen in Q1 of 2026. And then as we go into G&A, we've been continuing to see the decline in our stock comp expense year-over-year, and that trend will continue into Q4 as well. I think those are the main puts and takes on how we think about the profile for Q4.

John Kernan
Analyst, TD Cowen
Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you for your question. Our final question will come from the line of Angus Kelleher with Barclays. Your line is open.

----

Angus Kelleher-Ferguson
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. This is Angus Kelleher on for Adrienne Yih. Congrats on a solid quarter. I wanted to ask...

----

Trina Spear
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, FIGS, Inc.
Thank you.

----

Angus Kelleher-Ferguson
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
...how you are balancing – no problem, how you're balancing the elevated inventory growth against the plan to pull back on promotions. What safeguards are in place there to avoid margin pressure or excess stock? And I guess just more broadly, how do you feel about the composition of that inventory?

----

Sarah Oughtred
Chief Financial Officer, FIGS, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. So we've been intentionally investing in inventory to support demand and improve our core in-stock levels. And we've really seen improvement in those in-stock levels, which has been supporting our sales growth. We did have an impact from higher than expected in-transit inventory in the quarter, which we do view as positive. That does result from the work we're doing with our partners to drive consistency and execution, and it's ultimately driving shorter lead times. And so if you were to adjust for that higher in-transit, our unit growth would be low-double digit. So much more in line with our Q3 growth and our Q4 guide while also giving us the opportunity to, potentially, capture upside. So we're effectively getting products more efficiently and we do need to adjust.

And as we look at the go-forward, we would expect some moderation in unit growth. And that's really just as this in-transit timing adjusts. And then from a dollar growth perspective, we actually expect that to increase into the fourth quarter. And that's really a function of the tariffs impacting that inventory that's coming in. So our inventory is higher. We do have some pockets of inventory that we are working down. We've got some older fits profiles and

areas we intend to reinvest in the future seasons. We have made some good progress here, including with our targeted promotional effort and selective write-offs we were able to do and we do continue to make progress here and in the quarters ahead. And we're working on improving greater discipline and efficiency to our buying process. And over time, we do expect that inventory balance to come down over 2026 despite the higher tariffs.

----

**Angus Kelleher-Ferguson**
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
That's great. Thank you. And then if I could just squeeze one last one in about TEAMS. How is the TEAMS strategy evolving? How has the target customer shifted over time there? And then just if possible, any margin commentary you could share on the contribution of that business? Thank you.

----

**Trina Spear**
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, FIGS, Inc.
Well, first off, Angus, I just want to thank you for not ending on the inventory question. So thank you for adding something about TEAMS because I'm so excited to talk about our TEAMS business. So, it's really – we've been really focused on investing in our TEAMS business as we look to ensure an optimal foundation to set us up for the future. We've talked about our outbound strategy, bringing on new institutions that are looking to standardize and brand their teams and we've made a lot of progress.

The biggest kind of item that we're excited about is the upgraded technology, we mentioned it in the earlier part of this call. And so this is really designed for healthcare teams of all types and sizes. This platform is going to give organizations much more flexibility and functionality to purchase in the way makes sense for their team. We are on our way to becoming the employee store for all different types of healthcare professionals. That's going to go well beyond traditional group ordering, and this is going to introduce new capabilities like stipends, like gifting, different types of discounts based on your employee type. And so we're really excited about being able to roll out this upgraded TEAMS experience. It's going to feature our full product assortment. It's also going be able to support international TEAMS customers, which hasn't been the case. And so we think we're going to be able to unlock meaningful growth in the future. And then you asked about the margin point.

----

**Sarah Oughtred**
Chief Financial Officer, FIGS, Inc.
Yeah, the margin profile. So the TEAMS profitability is accretive bottom line. It has a lower gross margin profile just due to the offering of a higher discount. But then operating expense structure is much more favorable with the efficiencies both within outbound shipping as well as marketing. So excited with the overall economics that this business provides.

**Angus Kelleher-Ferguson**
