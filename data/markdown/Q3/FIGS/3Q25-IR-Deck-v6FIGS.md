## Product Innovation

We introduced new products across the layering system designed for maximum comfort, versatility, and durability, including:

- **FORMx Expansion**: Our new fabric with unparalleled stretch and a premium touch continued to gain traction this quarter with the support of new styles (Ora, Evanston, Alma) and expanded color options.

- **Sydney and Cobaki Vests**: The newest expansion of our best-selling scrub jacket silhouettes — sans sleeves. These lightweight layering pieces are perfect for warmer weather (and/or busted air conditioning).

- **Salta & Makato ¾ Sleeve Underscrub**: Informed by feedback from our community, the new ¾ length underscrub extends the lineup of our best-selling Salta and Makato franchises to enhance the FIGS layering system.

- **ArchTek® Compression Socks**: The first ever patented, medical-grade compression socks — available in ankle, crew, and knee-high across four compression levels — help reduce fatigue, swelling, and cramping while boosting circulation to keep HCPs comfortable and supported all day (and night) long.

## Build and Deepen Connection with Community

Earlier this year, we continued our important advocacy work in Washington, D.C. with actor Noah Wyle — work which went viral across our community.

When Noah was then nominated for Best Actor for The Pitt, he challenged us to make a tuxedo for the Emmys that was as comfortable as the scrubs he wears on set. We stepped up to the challenge by creating a first-of-its-kind tuxedo. With subtle details and craftsmanship, we were proud to support Noah’s desire to bring the healthcare community directly to the red carpet.

We strategically aired our Where Do You Wear Figs spot during the last commercial segment before the awards for Best Actor and Best Drama were announced. This was executed perfectly as Noah and The Pitt went on to win both of those awards coming out of the break. On stage, Noah eloquently dedicated his award to “anybody who’s going on shift tonight or who’s coming off shift tonight.”

This overall moment became among the most viral in our history with multiple “best dressed” nods for Noah and 175 total placements across traditional media and social. Most importantly, our actions led healthcare professionals — our Awesome Humans — to feel seen in a way they rarely do on the world’s biggest stage.

## Impact for Breast Cancer Awareness

N O T A B O U T P I N K . A B O U T P A T I E N T S — A N D T H E P E O P L E W H O F I G H T F O R T H E M .

When the world talks about breast cancer, it often stops at pink ribbons. FIGS started somewhere else: with the Awesome Humans who fight this disease every single day. The campaign gave voice to surgeons, nurses, oncologists and every healthcare professional who see both the human cost of cancer and the system that too often stands in the way of care.

One of the Awesome Humans featured in the campaign was Dr. Elisabeth Potter, a nationally renowned breast reconstruction surgeon whose advocacy for fair access to care has made her a leading voice for patients and the professionals who serve them. Her story anchored a powerful chorus of healthcare professionals calling for awareness that goes beyond symbolism to real change.

FIGS turned that message into measurable impact:
- $100,000 donated to The Bluebird Center for Healthcare Education and Access, Dr. Potter’s nonprofit, funding its first surgery for a patient denied coverage by their insurer.
- $50,000 donated to our longtime partners at F Cancer, supporting direct patient assistance and education initiatives.

By amplifying authentic voices and backing them with action, FIGS transformed Breast Cancer Awareness Month into a statement about what it truly means to care.

## Q3 2025 Operating Expense

- The decrease in selling expense in Q3 2025 as a percentage of net revenues primarily reflects the lapping of transition costs to our Arizona fulfillment center last year as well as successful efficiency and mitigation strategies across both fulfillment and shipping.

- The decrease in marketing expenses in Q3 2025 as a percentage of net revenues primarily reflects last year’s strategic investments to outfit the Team USA Medical team at the 2024 Summer Olympic & Paralympic Games and overall efficiencies in marketing spend.

- The decrease in G&A expenses in Q3 2025 as a percentage of net revenues was primarily related to meaningfully lower stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by higher people costs as we invest to scale the business.

## Updated Full Year 2025 Outlook

“FIGS’ third quarter was highlighted by top and bottom line results that exceeded our internal expectations, including the strongest revenue growth over the past two years. Our diligent work this year to support our community with a great product assortment and impactful brand moments has been instrumental in driving momentum across scrubwear, our U.S. business, and our business-as-usual selling days. Each of these is a key foundational area of our business and a great indicator of our brand health. We are the clear leaders in the space and believe our actions will compound the fundamental drivers of this healthy business over the long term.”

- Trina Spear, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder

“Our year-to-date performance shows we are executing strongly against plan and driving improved consistency across the business. Along with growing confidence in our fourth quarter positioning, we are meaningfully increasing our expectations with full year net revenues now expected to increase approximately 7.0% and adjusted EBITDA margin now expected above the high end of our original outlook despite tariff headwinds. With improving profitability and ample balance sheet flexibility, we believe we are positioned to remain on offense and drive the sustainable growth story we see ahead.”

- Sarah Oughtred, Chief Financial Officer

(1) “adjusted EBITDA” and “adjusted EBITDA margin” are non-GAAP financial measures. We have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of our adjusted EBITDA margin outlook to a GAAP net income margin outlook because we are unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to project certain reconciling items. These items include, but are not limited to, future stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, expenses related to non-ordinary course disputes, and transaction costs. These items are inherently variable and uncertain and depend on various factors, some of which are outside of our control or ability to predict. For more information on our use of non-GAAP metrics, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Operating Metrics” in the Appendix.

### NET REVENUES GROWTH VS. 2024

## NON - GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY OPERATING METRICS

Included in this presentation are certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and which are designed to supplement, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Company may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. The presentation of such measures, which may include adjustments to exclude unusual or non-recurring items, should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by other unusual or nonrecurring items.

The Company uses “net income, as adjusted,” “diluted earnings per share, as adjusted,” “adjusted EBITDA” and “adjusted EBITDA margin” to provide useful supplemental measures that assist in evaluating its ability to generate earnings, provide consistency and comparability with its past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its core operating results as well as the results of its peer companies. The Company uses “free cash flow” as a useful supplemental measure of liquidity and as an additional basis for assessing its ability to generate cash.

The Company calculates “net income, as adjusted” as net income adjusted to exclude transaction costs, expenses related to non-ordinary course disputes, other than temporary impairment of held-to-maturity investments, stock-based compensation, including expense related to award modifications, accelerated performance awards and associated payroll taxes and costs, ambassador grants in connection with its initial public offering, and expense resulting from the retirement of a former CFO of the Company, and the income tax impact of these adjustments.

The Company calculates “diluted earnings per share, as adjusted” as net income, as adjusted divided by diluted shares outstanding. The Company calculates “adjusted EBITDA” as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude: other income, net; gain/loss on disposal of assets; provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization expense; stock-based compensation and related expense; transaction costs; and expenses related to non-ordinary course disputes. The Company calculates “adjusted EBITDA margin” by dividing adjusted EBITDA by net revenues. The Company calculates “free cash flow” as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities reduced by capital expenditures, including purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs.

## NON - GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY OPERATING METRICS (CONT.)

The Company has also included herein “active customers,” “net revenues per active customer” and “average order value,” which are key operational and business metrics that are important to understanding Company performance. The Company believes the number of active customers is an important indicator of growth as it reflects the reach of the Company’s digital platform, brand awareness and overall value proposition. The Company defines an active customer as a unique customer account that has made at least one purchase in the preceding 12-month period. In any particular period, the Company determines the number of active customers by counting the total number of customers who have made at least one purchase in the preceding 12-month period, measured from the last date of such period.

The Company believes measuring net revenues per active customer is important to understanding engagement and retention of customers, and as such, the value proposition for its customer base. The Company defines net revenues per active customer as the sum of total net revenues in the preceding 12-month period divided by the current period active customers. The Company defines average order value as the sum of the total net revenues in a given period divided by the total orders placed in that period. Total orders are the summation of all completed individual purchase transactions in a given period. The Company believes its relatively high average order value demonstrates the premium nature of its products. As the Company expands into and increases its presence in additional product categories, price points and international markets, average order value may fluctuate.
