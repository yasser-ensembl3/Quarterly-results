1. Reporting entity
Constellation Software Inc. is a company domiciled in Canada. The address of Constellation Software Inc.'s
registered office is 66 Wellington Street West, Suite 5300, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The condensed consolidated
interim financial statements of Constellation Software Inc. as at and for the three and nine month period ended
September 30, 2025 comprise Constellation Software Inc. and its subsidiaries (together referred to as
“Constellation”, “CSI”, or the "Company") and the Company's interest in associates. The Company is engaged
principally in the development, installation and customization of software as well as in the provisioning of related
professional services and support for customers globally across over 100 diverse markets.
2. Basis of presentation
(a) Statement of compliance
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board (“IASB”) and using the accounting policies disclosed in Note 3 of the Company’s 2024 annual consolidated
financial statements, available on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR+”) at
www.sedarplus.com, except as disclosed herein.
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements were approved and authorized for issuance by the
Board of Directors of the Company on November 7, 2025.
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s 2024
annual consolidated financial statements.
(b) Basis of measurement
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except
for certain assets and liabilities initially recognized in connection with business combinations, derivative financial
instruments, equity securities, and contingent consideration related to business acquisitions, which are measured
at their estimated fair value.
(c) Functional and presentation of currency
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is Constellation's
functional currency.
(d) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, consistent with those disclosed in the 2024 annual
consolidated financial statements and described in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024
(Unaudited)
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical
experience and other assumptions that are considered reasonable in the circumstances. The actual amount or
values may vary in certain instances from the assumptions and estimates made. Changes will be recorded, with
corresponding effect in profit or loss, when, and if, better information is obtained.
3. Material accounting policies
Unless otherwise noted in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the material accounting policies
used in preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are unchanged from those disclosed
in the Company’s 2024 annual consolidated financial statements and have been applied consistently to all periods
presented in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently by Constellation’s subsidiaries.
4. Business acquisitions
(a) On June 2, 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of the shares of Cipal Schaubroeck NV (“CS”). The
Company paid cash of $228 plus issued an estimated cash holdback payable of $23 and contingent consideration
with an estimated acquisition date fair value of $7. The total consideration resulting from acquisition of CS is $258.
CS is a Belgium-based vertical market software provider active in the local government vertical. The acquisition
has been accounted for using the acquisition method with the results of operations included in the consolidated
financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 from the date of the acquisition.
The goodwill recognized in connection with this acquisition is primarily attributable to the application of the
Company’s best practices to improve the operations of the company acquired, synergies with existing businesses
of the Company, and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition including assembled
workforce. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The gross contractual amounts of acquired receivables was $31; however, the Company has recorded an allowance
of $0 as part of the acquisition accounting to reflect contractual cash flows that are not expected to be collected.
Due to the complexity and timing of this acquisition, the Company is in the process of determining and finalizing the
estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. The amounts determined on a provisional basis generally relate to
net asset assessments and measurement of the assumed liabilities. The provisional purchase price allocations
may differ from the final purchase price allocations, and these differences may be material. Revisions to the
allocations will occur as additional information about the fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available.
The impact of acquisition accounting applied on a provisional basis in connection with the acquisition of CS is as
follows:

Goodwill 26
Total consideration $ 258
The acquisition of CS contributed revenue of $39 and a net loss of $6 for the nine months ended September 30,
2025. If this acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2025, the Company estimates that pro-forma consolidated
revenue and pro-forma consolidated net income would have been $8,495 and $417 compared to the actual amounts
reported in the condensed consolidated interim statement of income (loss) for period ended September 30, 2025.
(b) During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, the Company completed a number of additional
acquisitions for aggregate cash consideration of $528 plus cash holdbacks of $182 and contingent consideration
with an estimated acquisition date fair value of $48. The total consideration resulting from the additional acquisitions
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025 was $758. The contingent consideration is payable on the
achievement of certain financial targets in the post-acquisition periods. The obligation for contingent consideration
for acquisitions during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025 has been recorded at its estimated fair
value at the various acquisition dates. The estimated fair value of the applicable contingent consideration is
calculated using the estimated financial outcome and resulting expected contingent consideration to be paid and
inclusion of a discount rate as appropriate. For these arrangements, which include both maximum, or capped, and
unlimited contingent consideration amounts, the estimated increase to the initial consideration is not expected to
exceed $79.

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024
(Unaudited)
Aggregate contingent consideration of $210 (December 31, 2024 - $174) has been reported in the condensed
consolidated interim statement of financial position at its estimated fair value relating to applicable acquisitions
completed in the current and prior periods. Changes made to the estimated fair value of contingent consideration
are included in other, net in the condensed consolidated interim statements of income (loss). An expense of $6
and $17 has been recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as a result of such changes
(income of $4 and an expense $12 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024).
No additional acquisitions were deemed to be individually significant. The majority of the businesses acquired
during the period were acquisitions of shares and the remainder were asset acquisitions. The cash holdbacks are
generally payable over a two-year period and are adjusted, as necessary, for such items as working capital or net
tangible asset assessments, as defined in the agreements, and claims under the respective representations and
warranties of the purchase and sale agreements.
The additional acquisitions during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025 include software companies
catering to the following markets: automotive, digital marketing, fashion, financial services, forestry, hospitality,
human capital, information technology, lighting design, maintenance management, manufacturing, software
infrastructure, supply chain management, technical service providers, travel, telecommunications, oil and gas,
transport, enterprise and resource planning, law enforcement, local government, fleet, utilities, asset management,
production and visualization, content management, craftsman, retail management and distribution, creative
agencies, pharmacy, sports, leisure, transit, education, real estate, publishing, disability, data collection, document
management, schools, logistics, and healthcare all of which are software businesses similar to existing businesses
operated by the Company. The acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method with the results
of operations included in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements from the date of each
acquisition.
The goodwill recognized in connection with these additional acquisitions is primarily attributable to the application
of Constellation’s best practices to improve the operations of the companies acquired, synergies with existing
businesses of Constellation, and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition including
assembled workforce. Goodwill in the amount of $4 is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The gross contractual amounts of acquired receivables was $100; however, the Company has recorded an
allowance of $12 as part of the acquisition accounting to reflect contractual cash flows that are not expected to be
collected.
Due to the complexity and timing of certain additional acquisitions made, the Company is in the process of
determining and finalizing the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired as part of the acquisitions closed
during 2025 and the last quarter of 2024. The amounts determined on a provisional basis generally relate to net
asset assessments and measurement of the assumed liabilities, including acquired contract liabilities. The
provisional purchase price allocations may differ from the final purchase price allocations, and these differences
may be material. Revisions to the allocations will occur as additional information about the fair value of assets and
liabilities becomes available. The cash consideration associated with these provisional estimates (including
individually significant acquisitions) totals $1,231.
The aggregate impact of acquisition accounting applied in connection with the aggregate of business acquisitions
that are not individually significant in the period ended September 30, 2025 is as follows:

The 2025 additional business acquisitions did not have a material impact to either the consolidated revenue or the
consolidated net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The materiality threshold is
reviewed on a regular basis taking into account the quantitative (contribution to revenue and net income (loss)) and
qualitative (size and comparability with other Constellation businesses) factors of current period acquisitions on
both an individual and aggregate basis.

5. Investments accounted for using the equity method
On January 31, 2025, the Company purchased 8,300,029 shares in Asseco Poland S.A. (“Asseco”) representing
approximately 9.99% of the issued shares in Asseco. The Asseco shares were acquired at a price of 85 PLN per
share for total consideration of $174. Asseco offers comprehensive, proprietary IT solutions for all sectors of the
economy and is listed on the Polish Warsaw Stock Exchange (the “WSE”). The Company has made an irrevocable
election at the time of initial recognition to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income
(“FVOCI”). The Company designated the Asseco investment as equity securities at FVOCI because the investment
in Asseco represents an investment that the Company intends to hold for the long term. At the time the Company
purchased shares of Asseco, the trading price per Asseco share on the WSE was in excess of the purchase price
of 85 PLN per share. The Company has recorded the initial gain of $35 in the statement of income (loss) with
subsequent changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2025, the Company recorded a loss of $5 and a gain of $211 based on the share price as at
September 25, 2025 within other comprehensive income reduced by transaction costs of $2.
On February 4, 2025, the Company entered into a binding agreement in respect of the acquisition of 12,318,863
treasury shares of Asseco. These shares represent 14.84% of Asseco’s share capital. On September 25, 2025,
the Company received regulatory approval for the acquisition of the treasury shares and subsequent to this date,
applied the equity method of accounting to its existing 9.99% investment in Asseco. The Company elected to record
the investment in Asseco at cost under the equity method of accounting which comprised of the initial investment
of $174 (EUR 168) and transaction fees of $2 (EUR 2) for a total cost of $176 (EUR 170). As a result, Topicus
reversed previous fair value adjustments and recorded a loss in the condensed consolidated interim statement of
income of $260 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Under the equity method of accounting,
the investment is initially recognized at cost and is subsequently adjusted to reflect Topicus’ share of profit or loss
and other comprehensive income of Asseco. Topicus also reclassified their investment from “Equity securities” into
“Investments accounted for under the equity method”. Due to the complexity and timing of the investment, the
Company is in the process of determining and finalizing the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. The
provisional purchase price allocation may differ from the final purchase price allocation, and these differences may
be material. Revisions to the allocation will occur as additional information about the fair value of assets and
liabilities becomes available. The fair value of the Company’s 9.99% investment in Asseco based on the share
price of Asseco at September 30, 2025 is $457.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company received a dividend of $9 from Asseco. The
dividend has been included in net income and included in the line item “Finance and other (income) expenses”.
In anticipation of the acquisition of the 14.84% of Asseco’s share capital which closed on October 1, 2025 (note
20), the Company’s expected cash consideration held at September 30, 2025 for the purchase of these shares in
the amount of $289 (EUR 246) was subject to restriction as of September 30, 2025 and as a result, the balance
was classified as “Restricted Cash” as of September 30, 2025.

CSI Facility
On January 31, 2024, the Company completed an amendment and restatement of its existing credit facility
agreement (the “CSI Facility”). The facility limit was increased from $840 to $1,085, with a syndicate of existing and
new institutions. The agreement has also moved from a secured to an unsecured facility structure, which continues
to be available for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and working capital. The CSI Facility is
guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company. The CSI Facility bears a variable interest rate with no fixed
repayments required over the term to maturity. Interest rates are calculated at standard U.S. and Canadian
reference rates plus interest rate spreads based on a leverage table. The CSI Facility contains standard events of
default which if not remedied within a cure period would trigger the repayment of any outstanding balance. As at
September 30, 2025, $nil (December 31, 2024 – $nil) had been drawn from this credit facility, and letters of credit
totaling $13 (December 31, 2024 - $13) were issued, which limits the borrowing capacity on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
Senior Notes
On February 16, 2024, the Company completed a private offering of $500 aggregate principal amount of 5.158%
senior notes due 2029 and $500 aggregate principal amount of 5.461% senior notes due 2034 (collectively, the
“Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of
payment to all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, including the CSI Facility. The
Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company on the same basis as such subsidiaries have
guaranteed the CSI Facility. Transaction costs associated with the Senior Notes are being amortized through profit
or loss using the effective interest rate method.
Liability of CSI under the terms of the IRGA/TSS Members Agreement
On December 23, 2014, in accordance with the terms of the purchase and sale agreement for the initial acquisition
of Total Specific Solutions (“TSS”) by CSI, and on the basis of the term sheets attached thereto, Constellation and
the sellers of TSS along with certain members of TSS’ executive management team (collectively, the “Joday Group”)
among others, entered into a Members Agreement (the “TSS Members Agreement”) pursuant to which the Joday
Group acquired 33.29% of the voting interests in Constellation Software Netherlands Holding Coöperatief U.A.
(which was renamed to Topicus.com Coöperatief U.A., (“Topicus Coop”)), a subsidiary of Constellation and the
indirect owner of 100% of TSS at the time of the acquisition. Total proceeds from this transaction was EUR 39.

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024
(Unaudited)
On January 5, 2021, the TSS Members Agreement was terminated in conjunction with the acquisition of
Topicus.com B.V., the reorganization of Topicus Coop and the execution of the Investors Rights and Governance
Agreement (“IRGA”). The IRGA was established to create certain contractual obligations of the parties in respect
of the governance of Topicus and Topicus Coop. The IRGA provides for transfer restrictions in respect of the
ordinary units of Topicus Coop (“Topicus Coop Ordinary Units” or the “Topicus Coop Units”).
Any time after January 5, 2021, any member of the Joday Group has the right, at their option, to sell any number of
its Topicus Coop Units to CSI at a cash price per Topicus Coop Unit determined in accordance with the IRGA. Upon
the exercise of such option by a member of the Joday Group, CSI will be obligated to purchase 33.33% of such
Topicus Coop Units within 30 days, and an additional 33.33% on each of the first and the second anniversary of
such initial purchase with the exception of certain items which have been classified as a current liability.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, CSI can offer Topicus the right to purchase such Topicus Coop Units in lieu of CSI.
In the event of a change of control of CSI, any member of the Joday Group has the right, at their option, to sell all
of its Topicus Coop Units to CSI at a cash price per Topicus Coop Unit determined in accordance with the IRGA.
Upon the exercise of such option by a member of the Joday Group, CSI will be obligated to purchase all such
Topicus Coop Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CSI can offer Topicus the right to purchase such Topicus Coop
Units in lieu of CSI.
If CSI reduces its economic interest in Topicus by a sale or transfer of its economic interest (and not due to any
additional issuance of any shares or equity by Topicus) by more than one-third (calculated on a fully converted
basis in accordance with the IRGA), any member of the Joday Group has the right, at their option, to sell to CSI
one-third of its Topicus Coop Units at a cash price per Topicus Coop Unit determined in accordance with the IRGA.
Upon the exercise of such put option by a member of the Joday Group, CSI will be obligated to purchase all such
put Topicus Coop Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CSI can offer Topicus the right to purchase such Topicus
Coop Units in lieu of CSI. Any member of the Joday Group has a similar right to sell one-half or all of its remaining
Topicus Coop Units, respectively, at its option, if CSI further reduces its remaining fully-diluted economic interest in
Topicus by a sale or transfer of its economic interest by one-half and again if CSI sells its entire remaining economic
interest in Topicus.
All of the Topicus Coop Ordinary Units held by the Joday Group and Ijssel B.V. (collectively, the “Topicus Coop
Exchangeable Units”) are exchangeable, directly or indirectly, for Topicus Subordinate Voting Shares. All of the
above rights of members of the Joday Group apply to any Topicus Subordinate Voting Shares issued on an
exchange of Topicus Coop Exchangeable Units.
At any time after December 31, 2023, CSI has the right, at its option, to buy all of the Topicus Coop Units and
shares of Topicus held by certain members of the Joday Group (excluding Joday Investments VI B.V. (“Joday”)) at
a cash price per Topicus Coop Unit (or share of Topicus, as applicable) determined in accordance with the IRGA.
After December 31, 2043, CSI has the same right to buy all of the Topicus Coop Units and shares of Topicus held
by the remaining members of the Joday Group, including Joday.
In addition, if certain individuals affiliated with Joday are terminated from their employment with Topicus Coop or
an affiliate thereof for urgent cause (as defined in the Dutch Civil Code), CSI has the right, at its option, to buy all
of Topicus Coop Units held by such individuals at a cash price per Topicus Coop Unit determined in accordance
with the IRGA.
The Company has continued to classify the above obligations of CSI under the terms of the IRGA as a liability. The
main valuation driver in such calculation is the maintenance and other recurring revenue of Topicus. The valuation

(Unaudited)
of CSI’s obligations under the IRGA is also impacted by the change in the net tangible assets of Topicus (as defined
under the IRGA). As the net tangible assets increase (which is typically the result of net profits in the applicable
period), the valuation of CSI’s obligations under the IRGA increases. Maintenance and recurring revenue of Topicus
for the trailing twelve months on a pro-forma basis determined at the end of the current reporting period was used
as the basis for valuing the interests at each redemption date. Any increase or decrease in the value of such liability
is recorded as an expense or income in the condensed consolidated interim statements of income (loss) for the
period.
Debentures
On October 1, 2014 and November 19, 2014, the Company issued debentures with a total principal value of C$96
for total proceeds of C$91. On September 30, 2015, the Company issued another tranche of debentures
(collectively with the 2014 issuances called the “Debentures”) with a total principal value of C$186 for total proceeds
of C$214.
On October 6, 2023, a total of C$213 principal amount of debentures (“2023 Debentures”) were issued at a price
of C$133.00 per C$100.00 principal amount of 2023 Debentures purchased representing proceeds to the Company
of C$283 which was used by the Company to pay down indebtedness under its existing credit facility. The 2023
Debentures were issued as an additional tranche of, and will form a single series with, the outstanding C$282
aggregate principal amount of Debentures.
The Debentures have a maturity date of March 31, 2040 (the “Maturity Date”).
The interest rate from and including:
• March 31, 2023 but excluding March 31, 2024 is 13.3%
• March 31, 2024 but excluding March 31, 2025 is 10.4%
• March 31, 2025 but excluding March 31, 2026 is 8.9%
Subsequent from and including March 31, 2026 to but excluding the Maturity Date, the interest rate applicable to
the Debentures will be reset on an annual basis on March 31 of each year, at a rate equal to the annual average
percentage change in the All-items Consumer Price Index during the 12-month period ending on December 31 in
the prior year (which amount may be positive or negative) plus 6.5%. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest
rate applicable to the debentures will not be less than 0%. The Company may, subject to certain approvals, elect
the Payment in Kind election (“PIK Election”), in lieu of paying interest in cash, to satisfy all or any portion of its
interest obligation payable on an interest payment date by issuing to each Debenture holder PIK Debentures equal
to the amount of the interest obligation to be satisfied. The PIK Debentures will have the same terms and conditions
as the Debentures and will form part of the principal amount of the Debentures. If, on any interest payment date,
the Company fails to pay the amount of interest owing on the Debentures in full in cash, the Company will not (A)
declare or pay dividends of any kind on the Common Shares, nor (B) participate in any share buyback or redemption
involving the Common Shares, until the date on which the Company pays such interest (or the unpaid portion
thereof) in cash to holders of the Debentures; however, where the Company has issued PIK Debentures in respect
of all or a portion of the amount of interest owing on the Debentures on an interest payment date, the Company
may resume declaring or paying dividends of any kind on the Common Shares and participating in any share
buyback or redemption involving the Common Shares beginning on the next earlier of (i) the interest payment date
of which the Company pays the amount of interest owing on the Debentures in full in cash and (ii) the date on which
the Company repays all amounts owing under the PIK Debenture. All payments in respect of the Debentures will
be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the Company.

(Unaudited)
The Debentures will be redeemable in certain circumstances at the option of the Company or the holder. During
the period beginning on March 16 and ending on March 31 of each year, the Company will have the right, at its
option, to give notice to holders of Debentures of its intention to redeem the Debentures, in whole or in part, on
March 31 in the year that is five years following the year in which notice is given, at a price equal to the principal
amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the date fixed for redemption. During the
period beginning on March 1 and ending on March 15 of each year, holders of Debentures will also have the right,
at their option, to give notice to the Company of their intention to require the Company to repurchase (or to “put”)
the Debentures, in whole or in part, on March 31 in the year that is five years following the year in which notice is
given, at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the date
fixed for repurchase.
During the year to date periods ended September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, no notices for redemption of
the Debentures were received or given by the Company.
The fair value of the debentures as at September 30, 2025 was $423 (December 31, 2024 - $410).
Term Loan
One of CSI’s subsidiaries has entered into a GBP 65 term debt facility with a financial institution for which CSI has
guaranteed the debt. The facility bears a fixed rate of interest. The term loan contains events of default that, if not
remedied, allow the loan note holder to require repayment of the loan principal and interest. The loan is due in
2028.
9. Debt without recourse to CSI
Certain of CSI’s subsidiaries have entered into term debt facilities and revolving credit facilities with various financial
institutions. CSI does not guarantee the debt of these subsidiaries, nor are there any cross-guarantees between
subsidiaries. The credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the borrowing entity and its
subsidiaries. The credit facilities typically bear interest at a rate calculated using an interest rate index plus a margin.
The financing arrangements for each subsidiary typically contain certain restrictive covenants, which may include
limitations or prohibitions on additional indebtedness, payment of cash dividends, redemption of capital, capital
spending, making of acquisitions and sales of assets. In addition, certain financial covenants must be met by those
subsidiaries that have outstanding debt.
In conjunction with the acquisition of Optimal Blue, the Company had entered into a promissory note agreement
(“Promissory Note”). The Promissory Note accrues interest at a rate of 7% per annum, is compounded annually
and is payable in arrears. The first cash interest and principal payment under the Promissory Note is due on the
day prior to the fifth anniversary and thereafter interest and principal payments will be due annually on the
subsequent anniversaries of that date. The Promissory Note matures in 2063, subject to earlier optional
prepayment.

The provisions balance is comprised of various individual provisions for onerous contracts and other estimated

11. Income taxes
Income tax expense is recognized based on management’s best estimate of the actual income tax rate for the
interim period applied to the pre-tax income of the interim period for each entity in the consolidated group. As a
result of foreign exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and ongoing changes due to intercompany transactions
amongst entities operating in different jurisdictions, the Company has determined that a reasonable estimate of a
weighted average annual tax rate cannot be determined on a consolidated basis. The Company’s consolidated
effective tax rate in respect of continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was
32% and 38% (31% and 31% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024). The Company’s effective
tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, were impacted by the fair value adjustments on
certain investments and liabilities. In particular, changes in the valuation of the Company’s investment in Asseco
(Note 5) and the remeasurement of the liability associated with the IRGA (Note 8) impacted the overall effective tax
rate for the period.
On July 4, 2025, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the
“Act”). The Act repeals the requirement to capitalize and amortize domestic research and experimental (“R&E”)
expenditures under Internal Revenue Code Section 174 for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021.
During the third quarter of 2025, the Company recognized a current income tax benefit of approximately $50. This
is comprised of $11 relating to U.S. operations of Lumine, and $39 relating to the Company’s other U.S. operations,
and primarily reflects the immediate deductibility of current-year domestic R&E expenditures and the decision to
accelerate deductions of previously capitalized domestic R&E expenditures within Lumine. An offsetting deferred
income tax expense was recorded to reverse the associated deferred tax assets established in prior periods,
resulting in no net impact on total income tax expense or the effective tax rate for the quarter.
Consistent with management’s interpretation of the enacted rules, the Company’s other US operating members do
not expect to elect accelerated amortization of previously capitalized domestic R&E expenditures for the 2022
through 2024 tax years, as such an election would be expected to increase exposure to the Base Erosion and Anti-
Abuse Tax (“BEAT”).

As part of its tax planning strategy to mitigate potential BEAT liability, the Company expects to make an election
under Section 59(e) of the Internal Revenue Code to capitalize and amortize approximately $171 of R&E
expenditures over ten years. In connection with this expected election, the Company recognized a current income
tax expense of $40 during the quarter, offset by a deferred income tax benefit of an equal amount, resulting in no
net impact on total income tax expense or the Company’s effective tax rate for the quarter. Management continues
to evaluate the potential impacts of this election on future periods.
Constellation is subject to tax audits in the countries in which the Company does business globally. These tax
audits could result in additional tax expense in future periods relating to historical filings. Reviews by tax authorities
generally focus on, but are not limited to, the validity of the Company’s intercompany transactions, including
financing and transfer pricing policies which generally involve subjective areas of taxation and a significant degree
of judgment. If any of these tax authorities are successful with their challenges, the Company’s income tax expense
may be adversely affected and Constellation could also be subject to interest and penalty charges.

15. Financial instruments
Fair values versus carrying amounts
The carrying values of cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, dividends
payable, the majority of the acquisition holdbacks, and the CSI Facility, approximate their fair values due to the
short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of the debt without recourse to CSI approximate their
fair values as the debt is subject to market interest rates. The carrying value of the Senior Notes, IRGA liability and
the Term Loan with recourse to CSI approximates fair value.
Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyzes financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
• level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability either directly (i.e. prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• level 3 inputs are inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e.
unobservable inputs).
In the table below, the Company has segregated all financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value
into the most appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to determine the fair value
at the measurement date.
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value as at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024
in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are summarized below. The Company has no additional
financial liabilities measured at fair value after initial recognition other than those recognized in connection with
business combinations.

Estimates of the fair value of contingent consideration are performed by the Company on a quarterly basis. Key
unobservable inputs include revenue/profitability growth rates and the discount rates applied (7% to 11%). The
estimated fair value increases as the annual revenue/profitability growth rate increases and as the discount rate
decreases and vice versa.
Derivative Asset:
On February 4, 2025, the Company entered into a binding agreement in respect of the acquisition of 12,318,863
treasury shares of Asseco Poland S.A. (“Asseco”). These shares represent 14.84% of Asseco’s share capital and
will be purchased at a price of PLN 85 per share. The contract to acquire the additional shares of Asseco is a
derivative under IFRS Accounting Standards and has been recorded at fair value as of September 30, 2025. Key
unobservable inputs include the discount associated with the trading volume of Asseco and the size of the block of

shares underlying the contract. The estimated fair value of the derivative asset decreases as the discount
increases. The estimated fair value of the asset increases as the discount decreases. The key observable input is
the share price of Asseco. As the Asseco share price increases, the fair value of the derivative increases. As the
Asseco share price decreases, the fair value of the derivative decreases. During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2025, income of $115 and income of $119 was recorded.
Derivative Liability:
On February 3, 2025, Topicus announced the signing of a shareholders’ agreement which was entered into with
the Adam Góral Family Foundation governing their cooperation as shareholders in Asseco. Under the terms of the
agreement, certain parties have the right to buy up to 1.7% (1,411,006 shares) of Asseco’s shares from the
Company at a purchase price of PLN 85. The contract is a derivative under IFRS Accounting Standards and has
been recorded at fair value as of September 30, 2025. The key observable input is the share price of Asseco. As
the Asseco share price increases, the fair value of the derivative liability increases. As the Asseco share price
decreases, the fair value of the derivative liability decreases. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2025, an expense of $44 was recorded. The derivative liability is included within “Accounts Payable and accrued
liabilities” as of September 30, 2025.
16. Contingencies
In the normal course of operations, the Company is subject to litigation and claims from time to time. The Company
may also be subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims, including environmental, labour, income and sales
tax, product, customer disputes and other matters. Management believes that adequate provisions have been
recorded in the accounts where required. Although it is not always possible to estimate the extent of potential costs,
if any, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such contingencies will not have a material adverse
impact on the results of operations, financial position or liquidity of the Company.
