CONSTELLATION SOFTWARE INC.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (“MD&A”)
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2025, which
we prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board (IFRS). Certain information included herein is forward-looking and based upon assumptions and anticipated
results that are subject to uncertainties. Should one or more of these uncertainties materialize or should the
underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from those expected. See “Forward-
Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties”.
Unless otherwise indicated, all dollar amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. All references to “$” are to
U.S. dollars and all references to “C$” are to Canadian dollars. Due to rounding, certain totals and subtotals may
not foot and certain percentages may not reconcile.
Additional information about Constellation Software Inc. (the “Company”, “Constellation” or “CSI”),
including our most recently filed Annual Information Form ("AIF"), is available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.
Forward Looking Statements
Certain statements in this report may contain “forward looking” statements that involve risks, uncertainties
and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company or industry to be
materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-
looking statements. Words such as “may”, “will”, “expect”, “believe”, “plan”, “intend”, “should”, “anticipate” and
other similar terminology are intended to identify forward looking statements. These statements reflect current
assumptions and expectations regarding future events and operating performance as of the date of this MD&A
November 7, 2025. Forward looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, should not be read as
guarantees of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of whether or not such
results will be achieved. A number of factors could cause actual results to vary significantly from the results
discussed in the forward looking statements, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed under “Risks and
Uncertainties”. Although the forward looking statements contained in this MD&A are based upon what
management of the Company believes are reasonable assumptions, the Company cannot assure investors that actual
results will be consistent with these forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are made as of
the date of this MD&A and the Company assumes no obligation, except as required by law, to update any forward
looking statements to reflect new events or circumstances. This report should be viewed in conjunction with the
Company’s other publicly available filings, copies of which can be obtained electronically on SEDAR+ at
www.sedarplus.ca.
Non-IFRS Measures
This MD&A includes certain measures which have not been prepared in accordance with IFRS such as
Free cash flow available to shareholders.
Free cash flow available to shareholders ‘‘FCFA2S’’ refers to net cash flows from operating activities less
interest paid on lease obligations, interest paid on debt, debt transaction costs, payments of lease obligations, the
IRGA / TSS membership liability revaluation charge, and property and equipment purchased, and includes interest
and dividends received, and the proceeds from sale of interest rate caps. The portion of this amount applicable to
non-controlling interests is then deducted. We believe that FCFA2S is useful supplemental information as it
provides an indication of the uncommitted cash flow that is available to shareholders if we do not make any
acquisitions, or investments, and do not repay any debts. While we could use the FCFA2S to pay dividends or
repurchase shares, our objective is to invest all of our FCFA2S in acquisitions which meet our hurdle rate.

FCFA2S is not a recognized measure under IFRS and may not be comparable to similar financial measures
disclosed by other issuers. Accordingly, readers are cautioned that FCFA2S should not be construed as an
alternative to net cash flows from operating activities. See ‘‘Results of Operations —Free cash flow available to
shareholders” for a reconciliation of FCFA2S to net cash flows from operating activities.
Overview
We acquire, manage and build vertical market software (“VMS”) businesses. Generally, these businesses
provide mission critical software solutions that address the specific needs of our customers in particular markets.
Our focus on acquiring businesses with growth potential, managing them well and then building them, has allowed
us to generate significant cash flows and revenue growth during the past several years.
Our revenue consists primarily of software license fees, maintenance and other recurring fees, professional
service fees and hardware sales. Software license revenue is comprised of non-recurring license fees charged for
the use of software products licensed under multiple-year or perpetual arrangements. Maintenance and other
recurring revenue primarily consists of fees charged for customer support on software products post-delivery and
also includes recurring fees derived from combined software/support contracts, transaction revenues, managed
services associated with CSI software that has been sold to the customer, and hosted software-as-a-service products.
Professional service revenue consists of fees charged for implementation services, custom programming, product
training, certain managed services, and consulting. Hardware and other revenue includes the resale of third party
hardware as part of customized solutions, as well as sales of hardware assembled internally and the reimbursement
of travel costs. Our customers typically purchase a combination of software, maintenance, professional services
and hardware, although the type, mix and quantity of each vary by customer and by product.
Expenses consist primarily of staff costs, the cost of hardware, third party licenses, maintenance and
professional services to fulfill our customer arrangements, travel and occupancy costs, depreciation, and other
general operating expenses.
Preferred Share Investment in Lumine
On February 22 and 23, 2023 (as part of a series of transactions relating to the acquisition of WideOrbit
Inc. (“WideOrbit”)), the Company’s subsidiary, Lumine Group Inc. (“Lumine”), completed a corporate
reorganization. At the beginning of the period, the Company owned 63,582,712 preferred shares (“Lumine Preferred
Shares”) in the capital of the Company’s subsidiary, Lumine. The Lumine Preferred Shares were non-voting and
under certain conditions were redeemable at the option of CSI for a redemption price of $21.74 (the “Initial Face
Value”) per share. The redemption price was to either be settled in cash or through the issuance of a variable
number of subordinate voting shares of Lumine (“Lumine Subordinate Voting Shares”) based on the terms of the
Lumine Preferred Shares, or any combination thereof. The Lumine Preferred Shares were also convertible into
Lumine Subordinate Voting Shares at a conversion ratio of 1:2.4302106 at any time. The Lumine Preferred Shares
entitled CSI to a fixed annual cumulative dividend of 5% per annum on the Initial Face Value.
On March 25, 2024, all of the Lumine Preferred Shares were automatically converted into Lumine
Subordinate Voting Shares, and additional Lumine Subordinate Voting Shares were issued in satisfaction of the
amounts owing in connection with the accrued dividends on the Lumine Preferred Shares. As at September 30,
2025, CSI holds 157,553,539 Lumine Subordinate Voting Shares.
Subsequent to the conversion, CSI continues to consolidate Lumine and now reflects an equity interest of
61.40% (December 31, 2023 – 0%) in Lumine and a non-controlling interest of 38.60% (December 31, 2023 –
100%).

Comparison of the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024
Revenue:
Total revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 was $2,948 million, an increase of 16%, or $407 million,
compared to $2,541 million for the comparable period in 2024. For the first nine months of 2025 total revenues
were $8,446 million, an increase of 15%, or $1,083 million, compared to $7,363 million for the comparable period
in 2024. The increase for both the three and nine month periods compared to the same periods in the prior year is
primarily attributable to growth from acquisitions as the Company experienced organic growth of 5% and 3%
respectively, 3% and 3% respectively after adjusting for the impact of changes in the valuation of the US dollar
against most major currencies in which the Company transacts business. For acquired companies, organic growth
is calculated as the difference between actual revenues achieved by each company in the financial period following
acquisition compared to the estimated revenues they achieved in the corresponding financial period preceding the
date of acquisition by Constellation. Organic growth is not a standardized financial measure and might not be
comparable to measures disclosed by other issuers.

Overall expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 increased 14%, or $260 million to $2,141
million, compared to $1,881 million during the same period in 2024. As a percentage of total revenue, expenses
equalled 73% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 and 74% for the same period in 2024. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2025, expenses increased 12%, or $652 million to $6,230 million, compared to $5,578
million during the same period in 2024. As a percentage of total revenue, expenses equalled 74% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2025 and 76% for the same period in 2024. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2025 the change in valuation of the US dollar against most major currencies in which the Company
transacts business resulted in an approximate 2% and 1% increase in expenses respectively compared to the
comparable periods of 2024.
Staff expense – Staff expenses increased 11% or $151 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025
and 10% or $400 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 over the same periods in 2024. Staff
expense can be broken down into five key operating departments: Professional Services, Maintenance, Research
and Development, Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative. Included within staff expenses for each
of the above five departments are personnel and related costs associated with providing the necessary services. The
table below compares the period over period variances.

The increase in staff expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due
to the growth in the number of employees compared to the same periods in 2024 primarily due to acquisitions. Staff
expenses in the first quarter of every year are typically higher as a percentage of revenue as compared to other
quarters, largely attributable to increased payroll tax costs associated with our annual bonus payments that are made
in the month of March.
Hardware expenses – Hardware expenses increased 20% or $9 million for the quarter ended September
30, 2025 and 17% or $20 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 over the same periods in 2024 as
compared with the 15% and 19% increases in hardware and other revenue for the three and nine month periods
ending September 30, 2025 respectively over the comparable periods in 2024. Hardware margins for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2025 were 42% and 45% respectively as compared to 45% and 44% for the
comparable periods in 2024.
Third party license, maintenance and professional services expenses – Third party license, maintenance
and professional services expenses increased 18% or $43 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 and
15% or $107 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 over the same periods in 2024. The increase
is primarily due to third party license, maintenance and professional services expenses of acquired businesses.
Occupancy expenses – Occupancy expenses decreased 1% or $0.1 million for the quarter ended September
30, 2025 and increased 6% or $3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 over the same periods in
2024. The increase for the nine month period is primarily due to the occupancy expenses of acquired businesses.
Travel, Telecommunications, Supplies & Software and equipment expenses – Travel,
Telecommunications, Supplies & Software and equipment expenses increased 24% or $29 million for the quarter
ended September 30, 2025 and 16% or $59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 over the same
periods in 2024. The increase in these expenses is primarily due to expenses incurred by acquired businesses.
Professional fees – Professional fees increased 27% or $12 million for the quarter ended September 30,
2025 and 25% or $31 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 over the same periods in 2024. There

The contingent consideration expense amounts recorded for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2025 related to an increase (decrease) in anticipated acquisition earnout payment accruals primarily as a result
of increases (decreases) to revenue forecasts for the associated acquisitions. Revenue forecasts are updated on a
quarterly basis and the related anticipated acquisition earnout payment accruals are updated accordingly.
There are no individually material reasons contributing to the remaining variances.
Depreciation – Depreciation of property and equipment increased 13% or $6 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2025 and 10% or $13 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 over the same periods
in 2024. The increases are primarily due to the depreciation expense associated with acquired businesses.

2025 is primarily attributable to an increase in the carrying amount of our intangible asset balance over the twelve-
month period ended September 30, 2025 as a result of acquisitions completed during this twelve-month period.
Foreign exchange – Most of our businesses are organized geographically so many of our expenses are
incurred in the same currency as our revenues, which mitigates some of our exposure to currency fluctuations. For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we realized a foreign exchange gain of $17 million and loss
of $132 million respectively compared to losses of $30 million and $16 million for the same periods in 2024. The
following table provides a breakdown of these amounts.

The remaining foreign exchange gains and losses per the table above are primarily related to the unrealized
foreign exchange translation gains and losses of certain non-US dollar denominated working capital balances to US
dollars as a result of the depreciation or appreciation of the US dollar.
IRGA / TSS membership liability revaluation charge – On December 23, 2014, in accordance with the
terms of the purchase and sale agreement for the initial acquisition of TSS (as defined below) by CSI, and on the
basis of the term sheets attached thereto, Constellation and the Joday Group, among others, entered into a Members
Agreement (the “Members Agreement”) pursuant to which the Joday Group acquired 33.29% of the voting interests
in Constellation Software Netherlands Holding Coöperatief U.A. (which was renamed to Topicus.com Coöperatief
U.A.), a subsidiary of Constellation and the indirect owner of 100% of TSS at the time of the acquisition. Total
proceeds from this transaction was €39 million ($49 million).
On January 5, 2021, the Members Agreement was terminated in conjunction with the acquisition of
Topicus.com B.V., the reorganization of Topicus Coop and the execution of the IRGA. The IRGA was established
to create certain contractual obligations of the parties in respect of the governance of Topicus and Topicus Coop.
As of June 30, 2025 the Joday Group’s interest in Topicus Coop comprised 38,148,221 Topicus Coop Ordinary
Units (“Topicus Coop Units”) resulting in an interest of 29.38% in Topicus Coop. The IRGA provides for transfer
restrictions in respect of the Topicus Coop Units. See “Liability of CSI under the terms of the IRGA” below for
further details.
The valuation of the IRGA liability (previously the TSS membership liability) increased by approximately
2% or $16 million from Q2 2025, and approximately 34% or $236 million from Q4 2024. The increases are
primarily the result of the growth in TSS’ trailing twelve month maintenance revenue on a pro-forma basis

(primarily due to acquisitions) and an increase in net tangible assets (as defined under the IRGA) resulting from an
investment in equity securities. Maintenance revenue and net tangible assets are the two main drivers in the
calculation of the liability. The liability recorded on the balance sheet increased by 49% or $336 million over the
nine month period ended September 30, 2025 from $693 million to $1,029 million as a result of the revaluation
charge of $236 million and a $101 million foreign exchange loss. The IRGA / TSS membership liability is
denominated in Euros and the Euro appreciated 10% versus the US dollar during the nine months ended September
30, 2025.
Finance and other expense (income) – Finance and other income for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2025 was $83 million and $191 million respectively, compared to $18 million and $50 million
respectively for the same periods in 2024. The following table provides a further breakdown of expenses (income)
within this category.

Finance and other expense (income) $ ( 83) $ ( 18) $ (191) $ (50)
The increase in the fair value of equity securities primarily relates to the Company’s investment in Asseco
Poland S.A. (“Asseco”). On January 31, 2025, the Company purchased 8,300,029 shares in Asseco representing
approximately 9.99% of the issued shares in Asseco. The Asseco shares were acquired at a price of 85 PLN per
share for total consideration of $174 million. Asseco offers comprehensive, proprietary IT solutions for certain
sectors of the economy and is listed on the Polish Warsaw Stock Exchange (the “WSE”). The Company made an
irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to present subsequent changes in fair value in other
comprehensive income (“FVOCI”). The Company designated the Asseco investment as equity securities at FVOCI
because the investment in Asseco represents an investment that the Company intends to hold for the long term. At
the time the Company purchased shares of Asseco, the trading price per Asseco share on the WSE was in excess of
the purchase price of 85 PLN per share. The Company has recorded the initial gain of $35 million in the statement
of income (loss) with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. During the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recorded a loss of $5 million and a gain of $211 million
respectively based on the share price as at September 25, 2025 (see “Revaluation of investment accounted for using
the equity method to cost” below) within other comprehensive income reduced by transaction costs of $2 million.
The investment in Asseco has been classified as a non-current asset as at September 30, 2025 within “Investments
accounted for using the equity method”.
The increase in the fair value of derivative relates to the increase in the fair value of the derivative assets
associated with the Company’s binding agreement in respect of the acquisition of 12,318,863 treasury shares of
Asseco at a price of PLN 85 per share, offset by the increase in the derivative liability associated with a binding
agreement allowing certain parties to buy up to 1.7% (1,411,006 shares) of issued shares in Asseco from the
Company at a purchase price of PLN 85 per share. See Note 15 to the Company’s Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 for additional
information.
Finance and other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 includes a $29 million settlement
payment related to the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition that closed in 2024.
There are no individually material reasons contributing to the remaining variances.

Bargain purchase gain – Bargain purchase gains totalling $1 million and $6 million were recorded in the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 respectively, compared to an expense of $1 million and gain of
$4 million for the same periods in 2024, relating to acquisitions made in the respective periods. The gains resulted
from the fact that the fair value of the separately identifiable assets and liabilities acquired exceeded the total
consideration paid, principally due to the acquisition of certain assets that will benefit the Company that had limited
value to the sellers.
Impairment of intangible and other non-financial assets – Impairment expenses of $12 million and $23
million were recorded in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 compared to $2 million and
$17 million for the same periods in 2024. The expenses relate to businesses that have been unable to achieve the
goals established in their respective investment theses.
Redeemable preferred securities expense – The redeemable preferred securities expense for the three and
nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 was nil compared to nil and $58 million for the same periods in
2024. In conjunction with the acquisition of WideOrbit, Lumine issued 10,204,294 special shares of Lumine (the
“Lumine Special Shares” or the “Preferred Securities”) to the sellers of WideOrbit for an initial subscription price
of approximately $222 million. Holders of the Preferred Securities were entitled to convert some or all of their
Preferred Securities into Lumine Subordinate Voting Shares on the basis of 3.4302106 Lumine Subordinate Voting
Shares per Preferred Security, at any time.
The Preferred Securities were recorded at fair value at the end of each reporting period. The change in fair
value of the Preferred Securities was recorded as redeemable preferred securities expense (income) in the
consolidated statements of income (loss). Based on the Preferred Securities conversion right, the value of the
Preferred Securities was primarily dependent on the price movement of Lumine’s Subordinate Voting Shares. The
holders of the Lumine Special Shares were also entitled to a fixed annual cumulative dividend of 5% per annum.
On March 25, 2024, all of the Lumine Special Shares were automatically converted into Lumine
Subordinate Voting Shares, and additional Lumine Subordinate Voting Shares were issued in satisfaction of the
amounts owing in connection with the accrued dividends on Lumine Special Shares. Specifically, a total of
35,076,193 Lumine Subordinate Voting Shares were issued.
Revaluation of investment accounted for using the equity method to cost – On February 4, 2025, the
Company entered into a binding agreement in respect of the acquisition of 12,318,863 treasury shares of Asseco.
These shares represent 14.84% of Asseco’s share capital. On September 25, 2025, the Company received the last
outstanding regulatory approval for the acquisition of the treasury shares and subsequent to this date, applied the
equity method of accounting to its existing 9.99% investment in Asseco. The Company elected to record the
investment in Asseco at cost under the equity method of accounting which comprised of the initial investment of
$174 million and transaction fees of $2 million for a total cost of $176 million. As a result, the Company reversed
previous fair value adjustments and recorded a loss in the condensed consolidated interim statement of income of
$260 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.
Finance costs – Finance costs for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 increased $3 million to $74
million, compared to $72 million for the same period in 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025,
finance costs increased $9 million to $216 million, from $207 million for the same period in 2024. The following
table provides a further breakdown of expenses within this category.

Income taxes – We operate globally and we calculate our tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which
we conduct business. Our effective tax rate on a consolidated basis is, therefore, affected by the realization and
anticipated relative profitability of our operations in those various jurisdictions, as well as different tax rates that
apply and our ability to utilize tax losses and other credits. For the quarter ended September 30, 2025, income tax
expense decreased $6 million to $77 million compared to $83 million for the same period in 2024. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2025, income tax expense increased $61 million to $261 million compared to $200
million for the same period in 2024. Current tax expense has historically approximated our cash tax rate however
the quarterly expense can sometimes fall outside of the annual range due to out of period adjustments. Current tax
expense reflects gross taxes before the application of R&D tax credits which are classified as part of “other, net”
expenses in the statement of income (loss). The Company’s consolidated effective tax rate in respect of continuing
operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was 32% and 38% respectively (31% and 31%
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 respectively).
Constellation is subject to tax audits in the countries in which the Company carries on business globally.
These tax audits could result in additional tax expense in future periods relating to historical filings. Reviews by
tax authorities generally focus on, but are not limited to, the validity of the Company’s inter-company transactions,
including financing and transfer pricing policies which generally involve subjective areas of taxation and a
significant degree of judgment. If any of these tax authorities are successful with their challenges, the Company’s
income tax expense may be adversely affected and Constellation could also be subject to interest and penalty
charges.
Net Income and Earnings per Share:
Net income attributable to common shareholders of CSI for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 was
$210 million compared to $164 million for the same period in 2024. On a per share basis this translated into net
income per diluted share of $9.89 in the quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to net income per diluted
share of $7.74 for the same period in 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net income attributable
to common shareholders of CSI was $402 million or $18.96 per diluted share compared to $446 million or $21.04
per diluted share for the same period in 2024. There was no change in the number of shares outstanding.
Net cash flows from operating activities (“CFO”):
For the quarter ended September 30, 2025, CFO increased $168 million to $685 million compared to $517
million for the same period in 2024 representing an increase of 33%. For the nine months ended September 30,
2025, CFO increased $426 million to $1,944 million compared to $1,518 million for the same period in 2024
representing an increase of 28%.
Free cash flow available to shareholders (“FCFA2S”):
For the quarter ended September 30, 2025, FCFA2S increased $167 million to $529 million compared to
$362 million for the same period in 2024 representing an increase of 46%. For the nine months ended September

We experience seasonality in our operating results in that CFO and FCFA2S in the first quarter of every
year is typically the highest and CFO and FCFA2S in the second quarter of every year is typically the lowest. The
key driver impacting this seasonality is the timing of annual maintenance contract renewals. Our quarterly results
may also fluctuate as a result of the various acquisitions which may be completed by the Company in any given
quarter. We may experience variations in our net income on a quarterly basis depending upon the timing of certain
expenses or gains, which may include changes in provisions, acquired contract liabilities, foreign exchange gains
and losses, bargain purchase gains, and gains or losses on the sale of financial and other assets.
Spin-Outs

Inc. (collectively, the “Spin-Out Transactions”).
In connection with the completion of the Spin-Out Transactions, on January 4, 2021, all of Constellation’s
common shareholders of record on December 28, 2020 received, by way of a dividend-in-kind, 1.859817814
subordinate voting shares of Topicus.com (the “Spin-Out Shares”) for each common share of Constellation held.
Constellation’s equity interest in TSS prior to the Spin-Out Transactions was 66.7%. Constellation’s equity
interest in Topicus after completion of the Spin-Out Transactions on a fully diluted basis was approximately 30.4%.
Constellation’s equity interest on a fully diluted basis as at September 30, 2025 is approximately 31.3%. In addition,
Constellation as the holder of the Topicus Super Voting Share is entitled to that number of votes that equals 50.1%
of the aggregate number of votes attached to all of the outstanding voting shares at such time. As a result of the
Topicus Super Voting Share Constellation consolidated the financial results of Topicus with its financial results.
Lumine Group Inc.
On February 22 and 23, 2023 (as part of a series of transactions relating to the acquisition of WideOrbit Inc.
(“WideOrbit”)), the Company’s subsidiary, Lumine Group Inc. (“Lumine”), completed a corporate reorganization.
See “Preferred Share Investment in Lumine” on page 2.
The Company holds 1 super voting share of Lumine (the “Lumine Super Voting Share”). The Lumine Super Voting
Share entitles CSI to that number of votes that equals 50.1% of the aggregate number of votes attached to all the
outstanding Lumine Super Voting Shares, Lumine Subordinate Voting Shares and Lumine Special Shares. As a
result, the Company controls Lumine and has consolidated Lumine’s financial position and results of operations.
As at September 30, 2025, the Company holds 157,553,539 Lumine Subordinate Voting Shares and now reflects
an equity interest of 61.40% in Lumine and a non-controlling interest of 38.60%.
The tables below provide certain supplemental balance sheet, statement of income, and net operating cash
flow information of Topicus and Lumine for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Neither Topicus
or Lumine are considered a reportable operating segment of Constellation, however, management has chosen to
provide certain supplemental financial information to provide greater clarity into the operating performance and
cash flow from operations of Topicus and Lumine considering Constellation’s equity ownership. The financial
information includes the adjustments discussed in the “Finance and other expense (income)” section above.

Acquisition of business segment from Allscripts Healthcare Solutions
On May 2, 2022, Constellation, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, N. Harris Computer Corporation,
completed the purchase from Allscripts Healthcare Solutions (“Allscripts”) of Allscripts’ Hospitals and Large
Physician Practices business segment. This business segment now operates under the name Altera.
The tables below provide certain supplemental balance sheet, statement of income, and net operating cash

Cash less Debt ( 2,243) ( 2,187) (57)
Cash flows from operations exceeded the net capital deployed on acquisitions plus dividends during the
nine months ended September 30, 2025. Cash increased by $790 million to $2,770 million at September 30, 2025
compared to $1,980 million at December 31, 2024 and debt increased by $847 million to $5,014 million at
September 30, 2025 compared to $4,166 million at December 31, 2024. Debt includes the liability of CSI under
the IRGA. The increase to this liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 had no impact on cash. (See
“IRGA / TSS membership liability revaluation charge” above.)
Total assets increased $2,477 million, from $12,849 million at December 31, 2024 to $15,326 million at
September 30, 2025. The increase is primarily due to the $790 million increase in cash, the $281 million in restricted
cash, the $129 million increase in unbilled revenue, the $119 million increase in derivatives, the $162 million
increase in other assets, the $244 million increase in investments accounted for using the equity method, and the
$585 million increase in intangible assets. The increases in restricted cash, and investments accounted for using
the equity method resulted from the Company’s investments in Asseco. In anticipation of the acquisition of the
14.84% of Asseco’s share capital which closed on October 1, 2025, the Company’s expected cash consideration for
these shares in the amount of $289 million was subject to restriction as of September 30, 2025 and as a result, the
balance was classified as “Restricted Cash” as of September 30, 2025. At September 30, 2025 Topicus, Lumine
and other subsidiaries with non-recourse debt facilities hold approximately $968 million of cash. As explained in
the “Capital Resources and Commitments” section below, there are limitations on the ability of these subsidiaries
to distribute funds to Constellation.
Current liabilities increased $1,034 million, from $4,661 million at December 31, 2024 to $5,695 million
at September 30, 2025. The increase is primarily due to an increase in debt with recourse to Constellation of $261
million, an increase in debt without recourse to Constellation of $259 million, an increase in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities of $123 million and an increase in deferred revenue of $339 million mainly due to acquisitions

The net cash flows from operating activities were $1,944 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2025. The $1,944 million provided by operating activities resulted from net income of $420 million plus $1,958
million of adjustments to net income (primarily amortization of intangible assets, depreciation, IRGA/TSS
Membership liability revaluation charge, finance and other income, revaluation of investment accounted for using
the equity method to cost, finance costs, and income tax expense) offset by $2 million of cash used in non-cash
working capital, $2 million in transaction costs associated with equity securities and $430 million in taxes paid.
The net cash flows from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were $100
million, which is mainly a result of a net increase in debt facilities of $435 million, offset by interest payments of
$165 million, lease obligation payments of $97 million, and dividends paid to common shareholders of $64 million.
The net cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were $1,351
million. The cash used in investing activities was primarily due to acquisitions for an aggregate of $955 million
(including payments for holdbacks relating to prior acquisitions), the $174 million investment in Asseco equity
securities, plus the $289 million increase in restricted cash relating to the investment in Asseco equity securities
that was completed on October 1, 2025, offset by $100 million of acquired cash.
We believe we have sufficient cash and available credit capacity to continue to operate for the foreseeable
future. Generally our VMS businesses operate with negative working capital as a result of the collection of
maintenance payments and other revenues in advance of the performance of the related services. As such,
management anticipates that it can continue to grow the business organically without any additional funding. If we
continue to acquire VMS businesses we may need additional external funding depending upon the size and timing
of the potential acquisitions (see “Subsequent Events” below).

CSI Facility
On January 31, 2024, the Company completed an amendment and restatement of its existing credit facility
agreement (the “CSI Facility”). The facility limit was increased from $840 million to $1,085 million, with a
syndicate of existing and new institutions. The agreement has also moved from a secured to an unsecured facility
structure, which continues to be available for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and working capital.
The CSI Facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company. The CSI Facility bears a variable interest
rate with no fixed repayments required over the term to maturity. Interest rates are calculated at standard U.S. and
Canadian reference rates plus interest rate spreads based on a leverage table. The CSI Facility contains standard
events of default which if not remedied within a cure period would trigger the repayment of any outstanding balance.
As at September 30, 2025, nil had been drawn from this credit facility, and letters of credit totaling $13 million
were issued, which limits the borrowing capacity on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
Senior Notes
On February 16, 2024, the Company completed a private offering of $500 million aggregate principal
amount of 5.158% senior notes due 2029 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.461% senior notes due
2034 (collectively, the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and
rank equally in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness,
including the CSI Facility. The Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company on the same
basis as such subsidiaries have guaranteed the CSI Facility. Transaction costs associated with the Senior Notes are
being amortized through profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.
Liability of CSI under the terms of the IRGA / TSS Membership Agreement
On December 23, 2014, in accordance with the terms of the purchase and sale agreement for the initial
acquisition of TSS by CSI, and on the basis of the term sheets attached thereto, Constellation and the Joday Group,
among others, entered into a Members Agreement (the “Members Agreement”) pursuant to which the Joday Group
acquired 33.29% of the voting interests in Constellation Software Netherlands Holding Coöperatief U.A. (which
was renamed to Topicus.com Coöperatief U.A.), a subsidiary of Constellation and the indirect owner of 100% of
TSS at the time of the acquisition. Total proceeds from this transaction was €39 million ($49 million).
18



## Page 20

On January 5, 2021, the Members Agreement was terminated in conjunction with the acquisition of
Topicus.com B.V., the reorganization of Topicus Coop and the execution of the IRGA. The IRGA was established
to create certain contractual obligations of the parties in respect of the governance of Topicus and Topicus Coop.
As of December 31, 2024 the Joday Group’s interest in Topicus Coop comprised 38,148,221 Topicus Coop
Ordinary Units resulting in an interest of 29.38% in Topicus Coop. The IRGA provides for transfer restrictions in
respect of the Topicus Coop Units.
Any time after January 5, 2021, any member of the Joday Group has the right, at his or its option, to sell
any number of its Topicus Coop Units to CSI at a cash price per Topicus Coop Unit determined in accordance with
the IRGA. Upon the exercise of such option by a member of the Joday Group, CSI will be obligated to purchase
33.33% of such Topicus Coop Units within 30 days, and an additional 33.33% on each of the first and the second
anniversary of such initial purchase with the exception of certain items which have been classified as a current
liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CSI can offer Topicus the right to purchase such Topicus Coop Units in
lieu of CSI.
In the event of a change of control of CSI, any member of the Joday Group has the right, at his or its option,
to sell all of its Topicus Coop Units to CSI at a cash price per Topicus Coop Unit determined in accordance with
the IRGA. Upon the exercise of such option by a member of the Joday Group, CSI will be obligated to purchase all
such Topicus Coop Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CSI can offer Topicus the right to purchase such Topicus
Coop Units in lieu of CSI.
If CSI reduces its economic interest in Topicus by a sale or transfer of its economic interest (and not due to
any additional issuance of any shares or equity by Topicus) by more than one-third (calculated on a fully converted
basis in accordance with the IRGA), any member of the Joday Group has the right, at his or its option, to sell to CSI
one-third of its Topicus Coop Units at a cash price per Topicus Coop Unit determined in accordance with the IRGA.
Upon the exercise of such put option by a member of the Joday Group, CSI will be obligated to purchase all such
put Topicus Coop Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CSI can offer Topicus the right to purchase such Topicus
Coop Units in lieu of CSI. Any member of the Joday Group has a similar right to sell one-half or all of its remaining
Topicus Coop Units, respectively, at its option, if CSI further reduces its remaining fully-diluted economic interest
in Topicus by a sale or transfer of its economic interest by one-half and again if CSI sells its entire remaining
economic interest in Topicus.
All of the Topicus Coop Ordinary Units and Topicus Coop Preference Units held by the Joday Group and
Ijssel B.V. (collectively, the “Topicus Coop Exchangeable Units”) are exchangeable, directly or indirectly, for
Topicus Subordinate Voting Shares. All of the above rights of members of the Joday Group apply to any Topicus
Subordinate Voting Shares issued on an exchange of Topicus Coop Exchangeable Units.
At any time after December 31, 2023, CSI has the right, at its option, to buy all of the Topicus Coop Units
and shares of Topicus held by certain members of the Joday Group (excluding Joday) at a cash price per Topicus
Coop Unit (or share of Topicus, as applicable) determined in accordance with the IRGA. After December 31, 2043,
CSI has the same right to buy all of the Topicus Coop Units and shares of Topicus held by the remaining members
of the Joday Group, including Joday.
In addition, if certain individuals affiliated with Joday are terminated from their employment with Topicus
Coop or an affiliate thereof for urgent cause (as defined in the Dutch Civil Code), CSI has the right, at its option, to
buy all of Topicus Coop Units held by such individuals at a cash price per Topicus Coop Unit determined in
accordance with the IRGA.
The Company has continued to classify the above obligations of CSI under the terms of the IRGA as a
liability. The main valuation driver in such calculation is the maintenance and other recurring revenue of Topicus.
The valuation of CSI’s obligations under the IRGA is also impacted by the change in the net tangible assets of
Topicus (as defined under the IRGA). As the net tangible assets increase (which is typically the result of net profits
in the applicable period), the valuation of CSI’s obligations under the IRGA increases. Maintenance and recurring
19



## Page 21

revenue of Topicus for the trailing twelve months on a pro-forma basis determined at the end of the current reporting
period was used as the basis for valuing the interests at each redemption date. Any increase or decrease in the value
of such liability is recorded as an expense or income in the consolidated statements of income (loss) for the period.
The liability recorded on the balance sheet at September 30, 2025 was $1,029 million.
Debentures
On October 1, 2014 and November 19, 2014, the Company issued unsecured subordinated debentures (the
“Debentures”) with a total principal value of C$96 million for total proceeds of C$91 million. On September 30,
2015, the Company issued an additional tranche of Debentures with a total principal value of C$186 million for
total proceeds of C$214 million. On October 6, 2023, a total of C$213 million principal amount of Debentures
were issued at a price of C$133.00 per C$100.00 principal amount of Debentures purchased representing proceeds
to the Company of C$283 million which was used by the Company to pay down indebtedness under its existing
credit facility. The Debentures were issued as an additional tranche of, and formed a single series with, the
outstanding C$282 aggregate principal amount of Debentures.
The total principal value of debentures outstanding at September 30, 2025 was $356 million (C$495 million).
Guarantees
One of CSI’s subsidiaries has entered into a $87 million (£65 million) term debt facility with a financial
institution for which CSI has guaranteed the debt. The facility bears a fixed rate of interest. The term loan contains
events of default that, if not remedied, allow the loan note holder to require repayment of the loan principal and
interest. The loan is due in 2028.
Debt without recourse to CSI
Certain of CSI’s subsidiaries have entered into term debt facilities and revolving credit facilities with
various financial institutions. Except as noted above, CSI does not guarantee the debt of its subsidiaries, nor are
there any cross-guarantees between subsidiaries. The credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of the
assets of the borrowing entity and its subsidiaries. The credit facilities typically bear interest at a rate calculated
using an interest rate index plus a margin. The financing arrangements for each subsidiary typically contain certain
restrictive covenants, which may include limitations or prohibitions on additional indebtedness, payment of cash
dividends, redemption of capital, capital spending, making of acquisitions and sales of assets. In addition, certain
financial covenants must be met by those subsidiaries that have outstanding debt.
In conjunction with the acquisition of Optimal Blue, the Company entered into a promissory note agreement
(“Promissory Note”) with the seller, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. for $500 million. The promissory note accrues
interest at a rate of 7% per annum, is compounded annually and is payable in arrears. The first cash interest and
principal payment under the Promissory Note is due on the day prior to the fifth anniversary and thereafter interest
and principal payments will be due annually on the subsequent anniversaries of that date. The promissory note
matures in 2063, subject to earlier optional prepayment.
Debt without recourse to CSI comprises the following ($ in millions):

Other commitments
Commitments include operating leases for office equipment and facilities, letters of credit and performance
bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions in connection with facility leases and contracts with public
sector customers. Also, occasionally we structure some of our acquisitions with contingent consideration based on
the future performance of the acquired business. The fair value of contingent consideration recorded in our
statement of financial position was $210 million at September 30, 2025. As mentioned in the “Finance and other
expense (income)” section above, on January 31, 2025, the Company purchased 8,300,029 shares in Asseco
representing approximately 9.99% of the issued shares in Asseco. The Company has made an irrevocable election
at the time of initial recognition to present subsequent changes in FVOCI. At the time the Company purchased
shares of Asseco, the trading price per Asseco share on the WSE was in excess of the purchase price of 85 PLN per
share. The Company has recorded the initial gain of $35 million in the statement of income (loss) with subsequent
changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2025, the Company recorded recorded a loss of $5 million and a gain of $211 million respectively within other
comprehensive income reduced by transaction costs of $2 million. The investment in Asseco has been classified
as a non-current asset as at September 30, 2025 within “Investments accounted for using the equity method”. As
also mentioned in the “Finance and other expense (income)” section above, the Company has entered into a binding
agreement in respect of the acquisition of 12,318,863 treasury shares of Asseco, which is a derivative under IFRS
Accounting Standards. The fair value of this derivative recorded in our statement of financial position was $119
million at September 30, 2025. As also mentioned in the “Finance and other (income) expenses” section above, the
Company entered into a binding agreement allowing certain parties to buy up to 1.7% (1,411,006 shares) of issued
shares in Asseco from the Company, which is also a derivative under IFRS Accounting Standards. The fair value
of this derivative liability recorded in our statement of financial position was $44 million at September 30, 2025.
Aside from the aforementioned, we do not have any other business arrangements, derivative financial instruments,
or any equity interests in non-consolidated entities that would have a significant effect on our assets and liabilities
as at September 30, 2025.

The IRGA liability commitment assumes that the Joday Group has exercised their put option to sell 100%
of their interests back to Constellation. This option however has not been exercised as at November 7, 2025. See
note 8 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the three and nine month periods
ended September 30, 2025 for a discussion on the valuation methodology utilized.
Financial Instruments
The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, dividends payable,
the majority of acquisition holdbacks, and the CSI Facility, approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of
these instruments. The carrying value of the debt without recourse to CSI approximate their fair values as the debt
is subject to market interest rates. The carrying value of the IRGA liability and the term loan with recourse to CSI
approximates fair value.
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value as at September 30, 2025 and December 31,
2024 in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the three and nine month periods
ended September 30, 2025 are summarized below. The Company has no additional financial liabilities measured
at fair value after initial recognition other than those recognized in connection with business combinations and the
redeemable preferred securities.

• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly
(i.e. prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 inputs are inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).
Foreign Currency Exposure
We operate internationally and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses,
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, we believe movements in
the foreign currencies in which we transact will impact future revenue and net income. The impact to organic
revenue growth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was approximately positive 2% and 1%
respectively. We cannot predict the effect of foreign exchange gains or losses in the future; however, if significant
foreign exchange losses are experienced, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results
of operations, and financial condition. The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts from time to
time with the objective of mitigating volatility in profit or loss in respect of financial liabilities. In entering into
these forward exchange contracts, the Company is exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties to such contracts
and the possibility that the counterparties will default on their payment obligations under these contracts. However,
given that the counterparties are Schedule 1 banks or affiliates thereof, the Company believes these risks are not
material. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company did not purchase any contracts of this
nature.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As a general practice, we have not entered into off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Except for
insignificant and short-term operating leases and letters of credit, all of our liabilities and commitments are reflected
as part of our statement of financial position.
Proposed Transactions
We seek potential acquisition targets on an ongoing basis and may complete several acquisitions in any
given fiscal year.
Share Capital
As at November 7, 2025, there were 21,191,530 common shares outstanding.
Risks and Uncertainties
The Company’s business is subject to a number of risk factors which are described in our most recently
filed AIF. In addition, a new risk factor related to artificial intelligence is outlined below. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial also may impair our business and
operations and cause the price of the common shares to decline. If any of the noted risks actually occur, our business
may be harmed and the financial condition and results of operations may suffer significantly. In that event, the
trading price of the common shares could decline, and shareholders may lose all or part of their investment.
Many of our businesses use or plan to use artificial intelligence in their operations; challenges with
incorporating and managing its use may result in competitive harm or adversely affect the results of our
businesses.
Many of our businesses are in the process of incorporating artificial intelligence (“AI”) solutions into their
software, services, and operations. We expect that AI will generally continue to become more important to our
company and to our customers over time. Our competitors may incorporate AI into their products, operations or
services more quickly or successfully than us, develop superior products and services through the use of AI, or more
effectively develop or acquire access to AI software, services or tools, which could negatively impact our
businesses’ ability to compete effectively. AI may also reduce barriers to entry in the industries in which we operate,

resulting in increased competition and price pressure. Further, given the rapid pace of change and highly competitive
environment in connection with AI, there is an increased level of risk that the AI solutions that we develop or adopt
will not be effective or commercially viable.
While we aim to develop and use AI responsibly and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical and legal
issues presented by its use, AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving. The use of AI in our businesses may
generate risks with respect to harmful content, accuracy, perceived or actual bias, discrimination, human rights
claims, allegations of lack of transparency, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, breach of
contract, data privacy, cyber security and misuse of personal or protected information, among others. The use of
AI within our software products and our operations also bring the possibility of new or enhanced governmental or
regulatory scrutiny, legal liabilities, or ethical concerns that could adversely affect our operations, reputation, or
financial results. The rapidly evolving patchwork of existing and proposed laws and regulatory frameworks – and
general regulatory uncertainty – further expose us to challenges, uncertainties and additional costs in relation to
legal and regulatory compliance.
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures:
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures as defined
under National Instrument 52-109. The President and Chief Financial Officer have designed or caused to be
designed by those under their supervision, disclosure controls and procedures which provide reasonable assurance
that material information regarding the Company is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
management, including its President and Chief Financial Officer in a timely manner.
Internal controls over financial reporting:
The President and Chief Financial Officer have designed or caused it to be designed under their
supervision internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. The President and Chief Financial
Officer have been advised that the control framework the President and the Chief Financial Officer used to design
the Company’s ICFR is recognized by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
The President and the Chief Financial Officer have evaluated, or caused to be evaluated by those under
their supervision, whether or not there were changes to its ICFR during the period ended September 30, 2025 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s ICFR. No such changes were
identified through their evaluation.
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that its objectives are met. Due to inherent limitations in all such systems, no evaluations of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Accordingly, our
disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting are effective in providing
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our control systems have been met.
Subsequent Events
On November 7, 2025 the Company declared a $1.00 per share dividend that is payable on January 12,
2026 to all common shareholders of record at close of business on December 19, 2025.

On February 4, 2025, the Company entered into a binding agreement in respect of the acquisition of
12,318,863 treasury shares of Asseco, representing 14.84% of Asseco’s share capital, to be purchased at a price of
PLN 85 per share. The acquisition of the treasury shares closed on October 1, 2025. On October 1, 2025, the
restriction was released on the cash consideration and the total purchase price for the treasury shares was $289
million. On February 3, 2025, the Company announced the signing of a shareholders’ agreement which was entered
into with the Adam Góral Family Foundation governing their cooperation as shareholders in Asseco. The
shareholders’ agreement became effective as result of the acquisition of the treasury shares.
Subsequent to September 30, 2025, the Company completed or has open commitments to acquire a number
of businesses for aggregate cash consideration of $384 million on closing plus total estimated deferred payments of
$71 million for total consideration of $454 million. The business acquisitions operate in the transit, social media,
aviation, asset management, local government, enterprise resource planning, professional services, agri-food,
content management, telecommunications, driver education, healthcare, insurance, call centers, and financial
services verticals and are all software companies similar to the existing business of the Company.

registered office is 66 Wellington Street West, Suite 5300, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The condensed consolidated
interim financial statements of Constellation Software Inc. as at and for the three and nine month period ended
September 30, 2025 comprise Constellation Software Inc. and its subsidiaries (together referred to as
“Constellation”, “CSI”, or the "Company") and the Company's interest in associates. The Company is engaged
principally in the development, installation and customization of software as well as in the provisioning of related
professional services and support for customers globally across over 100 diverse markets.
2. Basis of presentation
(a) Statement of compliance
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board (“IASB”) and using the accounting policies disclosed in Note 3 of the Company’s 2024 annual consolidated
financial statements, available on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR+”) at
www.sedarplus.com, except as disclosed herein.
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements were approved and authorized for issuance by the
Board of Directors of the Company on November 7, 2025.
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s 2024
annual consolidated financial statements.
(b) Basis of measurement
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except
for certain assets and liabilities initially recognized in connection with business combinations, derivative financial
instruments, equity securities, and contingent consideration related to business acquisitions, which are measured
at their estimated fair value.
(c) Functional and presentation of currency
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is Constellation's
functional currency.
(d) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, consistent with those disclosed in the 2024 annual
consolidated financial statements and described in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024
(Unaudited)
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical
experience and other assumptions that are considered reasonable in the circumstances. The actual amount or
values may vary in certain instances from the assumptions and estimates made. Changes will be recorded, with
corresponding effect in profit or loss, when, and if, better information is obtained.
3. Material accounting policies
Unless otherwise noted in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the material accounting policies
used in preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are unchanged from those disclosed
in the Company’s 2024 annual consolidated financial statements and have been applied consistently to all periods
presented in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently by Constellation’s subsidiaries.
4. Business acquisitions
(a) On June 2, 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of the shares of Cipal Schaubroeck NV (“CS”). The
Company paid cash of $228 plus issued an estimated cash holdback payable of $23 and contingent consideration
with an estimated acquisition date fair value of $7. The total consideration resulting from acquisition of CS is $258.
CS is a Belgium-based vertical market software provider active in the local government vertical. The acquisition
has been accounted for using the acquisition method with the results of operations included in the consolidated
financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 from the date of the acquisition.
The goodwill recognized in connection with this acquisition is primarily attributable to the application of the
Company’s best practices to improve the operations of the company acquired, synergies with existing businesses
of the Company, and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition including assembled
workforce. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The gross contractual amounts of acquired receivables was $31; however, the Company has recorded an allowance
of $0 as part of the acquisition accounting to reflect contractual cash flows that are not expected to be collected.
Due to the complexity and timing of this acquisition, the Company is in the process of determining and finalizing the
estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. The amounts determined on a provisional basis generally relate to
net asset assessments and measurement of the assumed liabilities. The provisional purchase price allocations
may differ from the final purchase price allocations, and these differences may be material. Revisions to the
allocations will occur as additional information about the fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available.
The impact of acquisition accounting applied on a provisional basis in connection with the acquisition of CS is as
follows:

Total consideration $ 258
The acquisition of CS contributed revenue of $39 and a net loss of $6 for the nine months ended September 30,
2025. If this acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2025, the Company estimates that pro-forma consolidated
revenue and pro-forma consolidated net income would have been $8,495 and $417 compared to the actual amounts
reported in the condensed consolidated interim statement of income (loss) for period ended September 30, 2025.
(b) During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, the Company completed a number of additional
acquisitions for aggregate cash consideration of $528 plus cash holdbacks of $182 and contingent consideration
with an estimated acquisition date fair value of $48. The total consideration resulting from the additional acquisitions
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025 was $758. The contingent consideration is payable on the
achievement of certain financial targets in the post-acquisition periods. The obligation for contingent consideration
for acquisitions during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025 has been recorded at its estimated fair
value at the various acquisition dates. The estimated fair value of the applicable contingent consideration is
calculated using the estimated financial outcome and resulting expected contingent consideration to be paid and
inclusion of a discount rate as appropriate. For these arrangements, which include both maximum, or capped, and
unlimited contingent consideration amounts, the estimated increase to the initial consideration is not expected to
exceed $79.

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024
(Unaudited)
Aggregate contingent consideration of $210 (December 31, 2024 - $174) has been reported in the condensed
consolidated interim statement of financial position at its estimated fair value relating to applicable acquisitions
completed in the current and prior periods. Changes made to the estimated fair value of contingent consideration
are included in other, net in the condensed consolidated interim statements of income (loss). An expense of $6
and $17 has been recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as a result of such changes
(income of $4 and an expense $12 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024).
No additional acquisitions were deemed to be individually significant. The majority of the businesses acquired
during the period were acquisitions of shares and the remainder were asset acquisitions. The cash holdbacks are
generally payable over a two-year period and are adjusted, as necessary, for such items as working capital or net
tangible asset assessments, as defined in the agreements, and claims under the respective representations and
warranties of the purchase and sale agreements.
The additional acquisitions during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025 include software companies
catering to the following markets: automotive, digital marketing, fashion, financial services, forestry, hospitality,
human capital, information technology, lighting design, maintenance management, manufacturing, software
infrastructure, supply chain management, technical service providers, travel, telecommunications, oil and gas,
transport, enterprise and resource planning, law enforcement, local government, fleet, utilities, asset management,
production and visualization, content management, craftsman, retail management and distribution, creative
agencies, pharmacy, sports, leisure, transit, education, real estate, publishing, disability, data collection, document
management, schools, logistics, and healthcare all of which are software businesses similar to existing businesses
operated by the Company. The acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method with the results
of operations included in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements from the date of each
acquisition.
The goodwill recognized in connection with these additional acquisitions is primarily attributable to the application
of Constellation’s best practices to improve the operations of the companies acquired, synergies with existing
businesses of Constellation, and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition including
assembled workforce. Goodwill in the amount of $4 is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The gross contractual amounts of acquired receivables was $100; however, the Company has recorded an
allowance of $12 as part of the acquisition accounting to reflect contractual cash flows that are not expected to be
collected.
Due to the complexity and timing of certain additional acquisitions made, the Company is in the process of
determining and finalizing the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired as part of the acquisitions closed
during 2025 and the last quarter of 2024. The amounts determined on a provisional basis generally relate to net
asset assessments and measurement of the assumed liabilities, including acquired contract liabilities. The
provisional purchase price allocations may differ from the final purchase price allocations, and these differences
may be material. Revisions to the allocations will occur as additional information about the fair value of assets and
liabilities becomes available. The cash consideration associated with these provisional estimates (including
individually significant acquisitions) totals $1,231.
The aggregate impact of acquisition accounting applied in connection with the aggregate of business acquisitions
that are not individually significant in the period ended September 30, 2025 is as follows:

The 2025 additional business acquisitions did not have a material impact to either the consolidated revenue or the
consolidated net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The materiality threshold is
reviewed on a regular basis taking into account the quantitative (contribution to revenue and net income (loss)) and
qualitative (size and comparability with other Constellation businesses) factors of current period acquisitions on
both an individual and aggregate basis.

5. Investments accounted for using the equity method
On January 31, 2025, the Company purchased 8,300,029 shares in Asseco Poland S.A. (“Asseco”) representing
approximately 9.99% of the issued shares in Asseco. The Asseco shares were acquired at a price of 85 PLN per
share for total consideration of $174. Asseco offers comprehensive, proprietary IT solutions for all sectors of the
economy and is listed on the Polish Warsaw Stock Exchange (the “WSE”). The Company has made an irrevocable
election at the time of initial recognition to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income
(“FVOCI”). The Company designated the Asseco investment as equity securities at FVOCI because the investment
in Asseco represents an investment that the Company intends to hold for the long term. At the time the Company
purchased shares of Asseco, the trading price per Asseco share on the WSE was in excess of the purchase price
of 85 PLN per share. The Company has recorded the initial gain of $35 in the statement of income (loss) with
subsequent changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2025, the Company recorded a loss of $5 and a gain of $211 based on the share price as at
September 25, 2025 within other comprehensive income reduced by transaction costs of $2.
On February 4, 2025, the Company entered into a binding agreement in respect of the acquisition of 12,318,863
treasury shares of Asseco. These shares represent 14.84% of Asseco’s share capital. On September 25, 2025,
the Company received regulatory approval for the acquisition of the treasury shares and subsequent to this date,
applied the equity method of accounting to its existing 9.99% investment in Asseco. The Company elected to record
the investment in Asseco at cost under the equity method of accounting which comprised of the initial investment
of $174 (EUR 168) and transaction fees of $2 (EUR 2) for a total cost of $176 (EUR 170). As a result, Topicus
reversed previous fair value adjustments and recorded a loss in the condensed consolidated interim statement of
income of $260 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Under the equity method of accounting,
the investment is initially recognized at cost and is subsequently adjusted to reflect Topicus’ share of profit or loss
and other comprehensive income of Asseco. Topicus also reclassified their investment from “Equity securities” into
“Investments accounted for under the equity method”. Due to the complexity and timing of the investment, the
Company is in the process of determining and finalizing the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. The
provisional purchase price allocation may differ from the final purchase price allocation, and these differences may
be material. Revisions to the allocation will occur as additional information about the fair value of assets and
liabilities becomes available. The fair value of the Company’s 9.99% investment in Asseco based on the share
price of Asseco at September 30, 2025 is $457.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company received a dividend of $9 from Asseco. The
dividend has been included in net income and included in the line item “Finance and other (income) expenses”.
In anticipation of the acquisition of the 14.84% of Asseco’s share capital which closed on October 1, 2025 (note
20), the Company’s expected cash consideration held at September 30, 2025 for the purchase of these shares in
the amount of $289 (EUR 246) was subject to restriction as of September 30, 2025 and as a result, the balance
was classified as “Restricted Cash” as of September 30, 2025.

CSI Facility
On January 31, 2024, the Company completed an amendment and restatement of its existing credit facility
agreement (the “CSI Facility”). The facility limit was increased from $840 to $1,085, with a syndicate of existing and
new institutions. The agreement has also moved from a secured to an unsecured facility structure, which continues
to be available for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and working capital. The CSI Facility is
guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company. The CSI Facility bears a variable interest rate with no fixed
repayments required over the term to maturity. Interest rates are calculated at standard U.S. and Canadian
reference rates plus interest rate spreads based on a leverage table. The CSI Facility contains standard events of
default which if not remedied within a cure period would trigger the repayment of any outstanding balance. As at
September 30, 2025, $nil (December 31, 2024 – $nil) had been drawn from this credit facility, and letters of credit
totaling $13 (December 31, 2024 - $13) were issued, which limits the borrowing capacity on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
Senior Notes
On February 16, 2024, the Company completed a private offering of $500 aggregate principal amount of 5.158%
senior notes due 2029 and $500 aggregate principal amount of 5.461% senior notes due 2034 (collectively, the
“Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of
payment to all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, including the CSI Facility. The
Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company on the same basis as such subsidiaries have
guaranteed the CSI Facility. Transaction costs associated with the Senior Notes are being amortized through profit
or loss using the effective interest rate method.
Liability of CSI under the terms of the IRGA/TSS Members Agreement
On December 23, 2014, in accordance with the terms of the purchase and sale agreement for the initial acquisition
of Total Specific Solutions (“TSS”) by CSI, and on the basis of the term sheets attached thereto, Constellation and
the sellers of TSS along with certain members of TSS’ executive management team (collectively, the “Joday Group”)
among others, entered into a Members Agreement (the “TSS Members Agreement”) pursuant to which the Joday
Group acquired 33.29% of the voting interests in Constellation Software Netherlands Holding Coöperatief U.A.
(which was renamed to Topicus.com Coöperatief U.A., (“Topicus Coop”)), a subsidiary of Constellation and the
indirect owner of 100% of TSS at the time of the acquisition. Total proceeds from this transaction was EUR 39.

(Unaudited)
On January 5, 2021, the TSS Members Agreement was terminated in conjunction with the acquisition of
Topicus.com B.V., the reorganization of Topicus Coop and the execution of the Investors Rights and Governance
Agreement (“IRGA”). The IRGA was established to create certain contractual obligations of the parties in respect
of the governance of Topicus and Topicus Coop. The IRGA provides for transfer restrictions in respect of the
ordinary units of Topicus Coop (“Topicus Coop Ordinary Units” or the “Topicus Coop Units”).
Any time after January 5, 2021, any member of the Joday Group has the right, at their option, to sell any number of
its Topicus Coop Units to CSI at a cash price per Topicus Coop Unit determined in accordance with the IRGA. Upon
the exercise of such option by a member of the Joday Group, CSI will be obligated to purchase 33.33% of such
Topicus Coop Units within 30 days, and an additional 33.33% on each of the first and the second anniversary of
such initial purchase with the exception of certain items which have been classified as a current liability.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, CSI can offer Topicus the right to purchase such Topicus Coop Units in lieu of CSI.
In the event of a change of control of CSI, any member of the Joday Group has the right, at their option, to sell all
of its Topicus Coop Units to CSI at a cash price per Topicus Coop Unit determined in accordance with the IRGA.
Upon the exercise of such option by a member of the Joday Group, CSI will be obligated to purchase all such
Topicus Coop Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CSI can offer Topicus the right to purchase such Topicus Coop
Units in lieu of CSI.
If CSI reduces its economic interest in Topicus by a sale or transfer of its economic interest (and not due to any
additional issuance of any shares or equity by Topicus) by more than one-third (calculated on a fully converted
basis in accordance with the IRGA), any member of the Joday Group has the right, at their option, to sell to CSI
one-third of its Topicus Coop Units at a cash price per Topicus Coop Unit determined in accordance with the IRGA.
Upon the exercise of such put option by a member of the Joday Group, CSI will be obligated to purchase all such
put Topicus Coop Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CSI can offer Topicus the right to purchase such Topicus
Coop Units in lieu of CSI. Any member of the Joday Group has a similar right to sell one-half or all of its remaining
Topicus Coop Units, respectively, at its option, if CSI further reduces its remaining fully-diluted economic interest in
Topicus by a sale or transfer of its economic interest by one-half and again if CSI sells its entire remaining economic
interest in Topicus.
All of the Topicus Coop Ordinary Units held by the Joday Group and Ijssel B.V. (collectively, the “Topicus Coop
Exchangeable Units”) are exchangeable, directly or indirectly, for Topicus Subordinate Voting Shares. All of the
above rights of members of the Joday Group apply to any Topicus Subordinate Voting Shares issued on an
exchange of Topicus Coop Exchangeable Units.
At any time after December 31, 2023, CSI has the right, at its option, to buy all of the Topicus Coop Units and
shares of Topicus held by certain members of the Joday Group (excluding Joday Investments VI B.V. (“Joday”)) at
a cash price per Topicus Coop Unit (or share of Topicus, as applicable) determined in accordance with the IRGA.
After December 31, 2043, CSI has the same right to buy all of the Topicus Coop Units and shares of Topicus held
by the remaining members of the Joday Group, including Joday.
In addition, if certain individuals affiliated with Joday are terminated from their employment with Topicus Coop or
an affiliate thereof for urgent cause (as defined in the Dutch Civil Code), CSI has the right, at its option, to buy all
of Topicus Coop Units held by such individuals at a cash price per Topicus Coop Unit determined in accordance
with the IRGA.
The Company has continued to classify the above obligations of CSI under the terms of the IRGA as a liability. The
main valuation driver in such calculation is the maintenance and other recurring revenue of Topicus. The valuation

of CSI’s obligations under the IRGA is also impacted by the change in the net tangible assets of Topicus (as defined
under the IRGA). As the net tangible assets increase (which is typically the result of net profits in the applicable
period), the valuation of CSI’s obligations under the IRGA increases. Maintenance and recurring revenue of Topicus
for the trailing twelve months on a pro-forma basis determined at the end of the current reporting period was used
as the basis for valuing the interests at each redemption date. Any increase or decrease in the value of such liability
is recorded as an expense or income in the condensed consolidated interim statements of income (loss) for the
period.
Debentures
On October 1, 2014 and November 19, 2014, the Company issued debentures with a total principal value of C$96
for total proceeds of C$91. On September 30, 2015, the Company issued another tranche of debentures
(collectively with the 2014 issuances called the “Debentures”) with a total principal value of C$186 for total proceeds
of C$214.
On October 6, 2023, a total of C$213 principal amount of debentures (“2023 Debentures”) were issued at a price
of C$133.00 per C$100.00 principal amount of 2023 Debentures purchased representing proceeds to the Company
of C$283 which was used by the Company to pay down indebtedness under its existing credit facility. The 2023
Debentures were issued as an additional tranche of, and will form a single series with, the outstanding C$282
aggregate principal amount of Debentures.
The Debentures have a maturity date of March 31, 2040 (the “Maturity Date”).
The interest rate from and including:
• March 31, 2023 but excluding March 31, 2024 is 13.3%
• March 31, 2024 but excluding March 31, 2025 is 10.4%
• March 31, 2025 but excluding March 31, 2026 is 8.9%
Subsequent from and including March 31, 2026 to but excluding the Maturity Date, the interest rate applicable to
the Debentures will be reset on an annual basis on March 31 of each year, at a rate equal to the annual average
percentage change in the All-items Consumer Price Index during the 12-month period ending on December 31 in
the prior year (which amount may be positive or negative) plus 6.5%. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest
rate applicable to the debentures will not be less than 0%. The Company may, subject to certain approvals, elect
the Payment in Kind election (“PIK Election”), in lieu of paying interest in cash, to satisfy all or any portion of its
interest obligation payable on an interest payment date by issuing to each Debenture holder PIK Debentures equal
to the amount of the interest obligation to be satisfied. The PIK Debentures will have the same terms and conditions
as the Debentures and will form part of the principal amount of the Debentures. If, on any interest payment date,
the Company fails to pay the amount of interest owing on the Debentures in full in cash, the Company will not (A)
declare or pay dividends of any kind on the Common Shares, nor (B) participate in any share buyback or redemption
involving the Common Shares, until the date on which the Company pays such interest (or the unpaid portion
thereof) in cash to holders of the Debentures; however, where the Company has issued PIK Debentures in respect
of all or a portion of the amount of interest owing on the Debentures on an interest payment date, the Company
may resume declaring or paying dividends of any kind on the Common Shares and participating in any share
buyback or redemption involving the Common Shares beginning on the next earlier of (i) the interest payment date
of which the Company pays the amount of interest owing on the Debentures in full in cash and (ii) the date on which
the Company repays all amounts owing under the PIK Debenture. All payments in respect of the Debentures will
be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the Company.

(Unaudited)
The Debentures will be redeemable in certain circumstances at the option of the Company or the holder. During
the period beginning on March 16 and ending on March 31 of each year, the Company will have the right, at its
option, to give notice to holders of Debentures of its intention to redeem the Debentures, in whole or in part, on
March 31 in the year that is five years following the year in which notice is given, at a price equal to the principal
amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the date fixed for redemption. During the
period beginning on March 1 and ending on March 15 of each year, holders of Debentures will also have the right,
at their option, to give notice to the Company of their intention to require the Company to repurchase (or to “put”)
the Debentures, in whole or in part, on March 31 in the year that is five years following the year in which notice is
given, at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the date
fixed for repurchase.
During the year to date periods ended September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, no notices for redemption of
the Debentures were received or given by the Company.
The fair value of the debentures as at September 30, 2025 was $423 (December 31, 2024 - $410).
Term Loan
One of CSI’s subsidiaries has entered into a GBP 65 term debt facility with a financial institution for which CSI has
guaranteed the debt. The facility bears a fixed rate of interest. The term loan contains events of default that, if not
remedied, allow the loan note holder to require repayment of the loan principal and interest. The loan is due in
2028.
9. Debt without recourse to CSI
Certain of CSI’s subsidiaries have entered into term debt facilities and revolving credit facilities with various financial
institutions. CSI does not guarantee the debt of these subsidiaries, nor are there any cross-guarantees between
subsidiaries. The credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the borrowing entity and its
subsidiaries. The credit facilities typically bear interest at a rate calculated using an interest rate index plus a margin.
The financing arrangements for each subsidiary typically contain certain restrictive covenants, which may include
limitations or prohibitions on additional indebtedness, payment of cash dividends, redemption of capital, capital
spending, making of acquisitions and sales of assets. In addition, certain financial covenants must be met by those
subsidiaries that have outstanding debt.
In conjunction with the acquisition of Optimal Blue, the Company had entered into a promissory note agreement
(“Promissory Note”). The Promissory Note accrues interest at a rate of 7% per annum, is compounded annually
and is payable in arrears. The first cash interest and principal payment under the Promissory Note is due on the
day prior to the fifth anniversary and thereafter interest and principal payments will be due annually on the
subsequent anniversaries of that date. The Promissory Note matures in 2063, subject to earlier optional
prepayment.

The provisions balance is comprised of various individual provisions for onerous contracts and other estimated

11. Income taxes
Income tax expense is recognized based on management’s best estimate of the actual income tax rate for the
interim period applied to the pre-tax income of the interim period for each entity in the consolidated group. As a
result of foreign exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and ongoing changes due to intercompany transactions
amongst entities operating in different jurisdictions, the Company has determined that a reasonable estimate of a
weighted average annual tax rate cannot be determined on a consolidated basis. The Company’s consolidated
effective tax rate in respect of continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was
32% and 38% (31% and 31% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024). The Company’s effective
tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, were impacted by the fair value adjustments on
certain investments and liabilities. In particular, changes in the valuation of the Company’s investment in Asseco
(Note 5) and the remeasurement of the liability associated with the IRGA (Note 8) impacted the overall effective tax
rate for the period.
On July 4, 2025, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the
“Act”). The Act repeals the requirement to capitalize and amortize domestic research and experimental (“R&E”)
expenditures under Internal Revenue Code Section 174 for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021.
During the third quarter of 2025, the Company recognized a current income tax benefit of approximately $50. This
is comprised of $11 relating to U.S. operations of Lumine, and $39 relating to the Company’s other U.S. operations,
and primarily reflects the immediate deductibility of current-year domestic R&E expenditures and the decision to
accelerate deductions of previously capitalized domestic R&E expenditures within Lumine. An offsetting deferred
income tax expense was recorded to reverse the associated deferred tax assets established in prior periods,
resulting in no net impact on total income tax expense or the effective tax rate for the quarter.
Consistent with management’s interpretation of the enacted rules, the Company’s other US operating members do
not expect to elect accelerated amortization of previously capitalized domestic R&E expenditures for the 2022
through 2024 tax years, as such an election would be expected to increase exposure to the Base Erosion and Anti-
Abuse Tax (“BEAT”).

(Unaudited)
As part of its tax planning strategy to mitigate potential BEAT liability, the Company expects to make an election
under Section 59(e) of the Internal Revenue Code to capitalize and amortize approximately $171 of R&E
expenditures over ten years. In connection with this expected election, the Company recognized a current income
tax expense of $40 during the quarter, offset by a deferred income tax benefit of an equal amount, resulting in no
net impact on total income tax expense or the Company’s effective tax rate for the quarter. Management continues
to evaluate the potential impacts of this election on future periods.
Constellation is subject to tax audits in the countries in which the Company does business globally. These tax
audits could result in additional tax expense in future periods relating to historical filings. Reviews by tax authorities
generally focus on, but are not limited to, the validity of the Company’s intercompany transactions, including
financing and transfer pricing policies which generally involve subjective areas of taxation and a significant degree
of judgment. If any of these tax authorities are successful with their challenges, the Company’s income tax expense
may be adversely affected and Constellation could also be subject to interest and penalty charges.

15. Financial instruments
Fair values versus carrying amounts
The carrying values of cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, dividends
payable, the majority of the acquisition holdbacks, and the CSI Facility, approximate their fair values due to the
short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of the debt without recourse to CSI approximate their
fair values as the debt is subject to market interest rates. The carrying value of the Senior Notes, IRGA liability and
the Term Loan with recourse to CSI approximates fair value.
Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyzes financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
• level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability either directly (i.e. prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• level 3 inputs are inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e.
unobservable inputs).
In the table below, the Company has segregated all financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value
into the most appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to determine the fair value
at the measurement date.
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value as at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024
in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are summarized below. The Company has no additional
financial liabilities measured at fair value after initial recognition other than those recognized in connection with
business combinations.

Estimates of the fair value of contingent consideration are performed by the Company on a quarterly basis. Key
unobservable inputs include revenue/profitability growth rates and the discount rates applied (7% to 11%). The
estimated fair value increases as the annual revenue/profitability growth rate increases and as the discount rate
decreases and vice versa.
Derivative Asset:
On February 4, 2025, the Company entered into a binding agreement in respect of the acquisition of 12,318,863
treasury shares of Asseco Poland S.A. (“Asseco”). These shares represent 14.84% of Asseco’s share capital and
will be purchased at a price of PLN 85 per share. The contract to acquire the additional shares of Asseco is a
derivative under IFRS Accounting Standards and has been recorded at fair value as of September 30, 2025. Key
unobservable inputs include the discount associated with the trading volume of Asseco and the size of the block of

shares underlying the contract. The estimated fair value of the derivative asset decreases as the discount
increases. The estimated fair value of the asset increases as the discount decreases. The key observable input is
the share price of Asseco. As the Asseco share price increases, the fair value of the derivative increases. As the
Asseco share price decreases, the fair value of the derivative decreases. During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2025, income of $115 and income of $119 was recorded.
Derivative Liability:
On February 3, 2025, Topicus announced the signing of a shareholders’ agreement which was entered into with
the Adam Góral Family Foundation governing their cooperation as shareholders in Asseco. Under the terms of the
agreement, certain parties have the right to buy up to 1.7% (1,411,006 shares) of Asseco’s shares from the
Company at a purchase price of PLN 85. The contract is a derivative under IFRS Accounting Standards and has
been recorded at fair value as of September 30, 2025. The key observable input is the share price of Asseco. As
the Asseco share price increases, the fair value of the derivative liability increases. As the Asseco share price
decreases, the fair value of the derivative liability decreases. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2025, an expense of $44 was recorded. The derivative liability is included within “Accounts Payable and accrued
liabilities” as of September 30, 2025.
16. Contingencies
In the normal course of operations, the Company is subject to litigation and claims from time to time. The Company
may also be subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims, including environmental, labour, income and sales
tax, product, customer disputes and other matters. Management believes that adequate provisions have been
recorded in the accounts where required. Although it is not always possible to estimate the extent of potential costs,
if any, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such contingencies will not have a material adverse
impact on the results of operations, financial position or liquidity of the Company.
