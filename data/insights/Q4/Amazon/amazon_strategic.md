# Amazon.com, Inc. - Strategic Analysis
**Quarter:** Q4 2025

## Executive Summary

**TL;DR:** Amazon delivered strong Q4 with 14% revenue growth to $213.4B, powered by AWS re-acceleration to 24% growth and massive AI investments, while guiding for ~$200B in 2026 CapEx.

**Management Tone:** Optimistic

Management is bullish on AI as a transformational opportunity across all business segments. AWS is re-accelerating with its fastest growth in 13 quarters, custom chips (Trainium/Graviton) have reached a $10B+ ARR, and Rufus AI shopping assistant drove ~$12B in incremental annualized sales. Despite $2.4B in one-time charges and a 71% decline in FCF due to massive infrastructure investments, Amazon is doubling down with ~$200B in planned 2026 CapEx.

## Key Takeaways

1. AWS re-accelerated to 24% growth (fastest in 13 quarters) driven by AI demand, with custom chips surpassing $10B ARR at triple-digit growth
2. Amazon plans ~$200B in 2026 CapEx, the largest infrastructure investment cycle in the company's history, primarily for AI
3. Rufus AI shopping assistant reached 300M+ customers and drove ~$12B in incremental annualized sales, demonstrating AI monetization in commerce
4. Free cash flow declined 71% to $11.2B TTM as infrastructure investments accelerated, a deliberate trade-off for long-term positioning
5. Q4 revenue grew 14% to $213.4B with $2.4B in one-time charges; adjusted operating income would have been $27.4B
6. Advertising grew 22% to $21.3B becoming a major high-margin profit contributor alongside AWS
